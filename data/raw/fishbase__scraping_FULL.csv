Life cycle and mating behavior : Matures at increasing ages with increasing latitude (Ref. 88171 ). Both sexes do not spawn yearly and spawning intervals may vary according to area. In the St. Lawrence River, males spawn every 1-5 years, females every 3-5 years (Ref. 89103 ). Adults from the sea begin to ascend the lower reaches of large rivers in spring with the majority ascending immediately prior to spawning. Spawning occurs between March and August (Ref. 59043 ), when water temperature is 13.3-17.8 °C (Ref. 89118 ). Spawning occurs over bedrock, boulders or gravel bottoms, in depths exceeding 10 m at current velocities of 0.5-0.8 m/s (Ref. 59043 , 89103 ). Exact time of spawning depends on temperature (Ref. 26938 ). Per female 0.4-8 million eggs may be spawned (Ref. 45706 , 84845 , 89137 ). Eggs demersal, sticking to stones, measuring 2.55 mm in diameter and hatching in 1 week at 17.8 °C (Ref. 4639 , 9980 ). Adults return to the sea after spawning (Ref. 59043 ). Sturgeons in general have a high capacity for hybridization and most species are able to cross-breed (Ref. 89103 , 89117 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Potamodromous species (Ref. 57765 ). In a natural environment, males reach sexual maturity at 9-1 5 years of age and females at 16-20 years (in water recirculation systems, sexual maturity can first occur at 5 years). Spawning happens in the summer and generally every two years. Membranes on eggs become increasingly more sticky after fertilization and this allows them to stick to the substratum. This can become a problem in nurseries, but it is solved by washing the eggs in clay or diatomaceous earth suspensions. Caviar (not fecundated ovocites ) can be over 1 0% of the corporal weight of a mature female. Incubation lasts about 1 6 days (at 10-1 5°). Larval development lasts about 20 days (at 18°). Egg size 3.0-3.6 mm, larval length at hatching 10-12 mm.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Exhibit ovoviparity (aplacental viviparity), with embryos feeding initially on yolk, then receiving additional nourishment from the mother by indirect absorption of uterine fluid enriched with mucus, fat or protein through specialised structures (Ref. 50449 ). Bears up to 4 young (Ref. 5578 , 6871 , 37816 ). Width at birth 17-35 cm (Ref. 37816 ). According to Uchida et al (1990) (Ref. 51119 ) 'the male chases the female in mid water, then nibbles on her dorsal surface. The female stops swimming to begin copulation. The male bites the female on a pectoral fin and bends one clasper forward, then attempts an abdomen to abdomen copulation with either clasper, usually mid-water' (Ref. 49562 ). Copulation lasted for 20 seconds to 1 minute (Ref. 49562 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males assemble and wait at the spawning grounds for ripe females, which arrive later. Deposit sticky eggs which adhere on pebbles or stones. Embryonic development lasts 2-3 days, with larvae first staying among gravel for 8-11 days, then actively migrating to shallows and backwaters. Adults migrate back to sea, lakes or estuaries soon after spawning to forage. Young juvenile undertake downriver migration in autumn of same year or next spring (Ref. 59043 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Lays eggs on cleaned surfaces of rocks. Parents incubate eggs and guard young. Tends and fans the embryos and free embryos and transfers them several times into new pits excavated in the bottom using its mouth (huddling) (Ref. 34155 ). Dark cavities are preferred as nests to conceal the brood and make them less conspicuous to visual predators (Ref. 38966 ). When in caves, single entrances are favored to reduce the probability of intrusion and are probably more manageable for the females in terms of defending their brood (Ref. 38966 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : The female prepares the nest by clearing debris, gravel and silt found on the bottom. Before spawning, the pair engages in butting and in sliding its barbels over the body of the other. The female releases her eggs after the male wraps his caudal fin around the head of the female. The pair can spawn up to five times in an hour. In between spawning, the female fans the eggs. Both male and female guards and fans the eggs.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Nests are built by one or both sexes. After a period of caressing each other with their barbels, male and female settle over the nest, face opposite directions (while maintaining body contact) and spawn. Although eggs are cared for by one or both parents, there have been reports of parents eating their own eggs. Caring entails fanning by the paired fins, moving and stirring by the barbels, and may be picked up and ejected from the mouth; this ensures hatching.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Oviparous. Breeding sites may be found in rivers, lakes, ponds or swamps (Ref. 205 ). Breeding individuals are recorded at all depths, but the species appears to prefer shallow water (<50m) (Ref. 4916 , 27004 , 52142 ). It comes inshore to breed, a nest being made in shallow water on a sandy substrate (Ref. 4364 ). Nest are build by males, with a circular or oval shape, about 3 feet in diameter, the centre below the surface level (Ref. 4916 ). Reputed to breed among the rocks (Ref. 2781 , 52146 ), with nest often build so that rocks provide extra cover (Ref. 4916 ). Small fish are being guarded in their nests (Ref. 52142 ). The female exhibits parental care of her brood of young, in co-operation with nest-guarding territorial cichlids (Ref. 27004 ). In other studies, parental care is exhibited by both male and female (Ref. 52178 , 52179 ). Brood-mixing occurs when cichlid parents 'farm out' their young into broods of the catfish and in half the cases, the cichlid parents remain near by and assist in brood defence (Ref. 52143 ). Juveniles mainly feed on trophic eggs released by the female (Ref. 36945 ), whilst the male helps the young in searching for invertebrates in and around the nest (Ref. 36945 ). Mutualistic relationship with cichlids concerning defence and feeding of the young of both the cichlids and B. meridionalis (Ref. 52146 ). If the female, after laying the eggs, leaves the nest in charge of the male (which is generally smaller than the female) and goes back to deep water, this might account for the disparity in sex ratio observed between shallow and deep waters (Ref. 4364 , 4916 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Reproduction takes place during high water (Ref. 2756 ). There is some indication that the species comes to shallower water to breed (Ref. 43507 ). From 4 breeding fish taken, 3 were from inshore waters and 1 from 40m depth in the open water (Ref. 49805 ). The nest is a relatively large depression with the shape of a flat dish and proportions relative to the size of the fish (Ref. 51638 ). A single well formed hole of about 10-15cm in diameter and 10-15cm depth is present nearly in the middle (Ref. 51638 ). Eggs are laid inside this hole (Ref. 51638 ). Eggs are white, having a diameter of little more than 1 millimeter (Ref. 45962 ). Larvae stay in the hole a couple of days after hatching (Ref. 51638 ). They swim above the nest when disturbed and return to hole after disturbance has stopped (Ref. 51638 ).

Beryx_decadactylus,https://www.fishbase.de/summary/Beryx-decadactylus.html,"Classification / Names : Teleostei (teleosts) > Beryciformes (Sawbellies) > Berycidae (Alfonsinos) Etymology: Beryx: Greek, beryx or berys = a name of a fish. Cuvier & Valenciennes (1829:221) precise that the name was used by Gesner from Varinus, but with no indication whatsoever helping identifying any species. After D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (A glossary of Greek fishes, 1947), the name actually seems to come originally from Hesychius, but perhaps the name was not originally a fish name.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Females spawn with several other species, for example Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius , but the eggs just develop without being actually fertilized resulting in a female only population (Ref. 2059 ). In Europe, populations considered as triploid and only females. But in some populations, it should be possible to find up to 25% of males which should be diploid (Ref. 40476 ). ""There are also all-female populations in which all individuals are triploids. Triploids are sperm parasites of other cyprinid species such as Cyprinus carpio , Rutilus rutilus and Abramis brama . Older individuals spawn earlier in season than younger ones. Males move to spawning sites before females. Males follow ripe females, often with much splashing. Sticky eggs are attached to water plants or submerged objects"" (Ref. 59043 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adults home to certain gravelly spawning streams. Two to four males crowd around a female and press against her with their fins. Eggs are scattered and adhere to the gravel or are carried downstream and adhere to the substrate when the water is calmer. The spawning act lasts for 3-4 seconds and may occur 6-40 times an hour (Ref. 1998 ). Spent adults return to the lake 10-14 days after spawning began. Most females return to the lake during the first half of the downstream migration followed by most males in the latter half. Downstream fry migration occurs between dusk and dawn (Ref. 10928 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Spawns only during daytime (Ref. 27547 ). At spawning, males lie close to the bottom in the current of the spawning area while females stay along the banks and in still water (Ref. 27547 ). A female moves from the bank of the stream usually escorted by 2-4 males to the spawning area at the center of the stream. The males crowd beside her; egg deposition occurs as the males try to clasp the female with their pelvic fins or vibrate against her with their anal fins. This spawning act lasts for 3-5 seconds and may occur as often as 6-40 times per hour. After the eggs are deposited, the sexes separate and return to their previous stream positions (Ref.1998). Fish that moved out of a lake to spawn generally return to the lake a few days after spawning. However, river-resident fish may stay on or near the spawning area for much of the summer (Ref. 27547 ). Many spawn in two or even three consecutive years but others may skip one or two years between spawning (Ref. 10928 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Oviparous. Spawning takes place during the rainy season in flooded deltas. The fishes make a lateral migration towards the inundated plains to breed and return to the river or lake soon afterwards while the juveniles remain in the inundated area. Juveniles return to the lake or river when they are between 1.5 and 2.5 cm long (Ref. 34291 ). First sexual maturity occurs when females are between 40-45 cm and males between 35-40 cm. Eggs are greenish. Incubations lasts little (about 33 hours at 25°C).

Life cycle and mating behavior : The pair manifests the 'spawning embrace' which is widely observed in other catfish species (Ref. 33313 ). The pair gently nudge each other in the genital region and flick their dorsal fins; male wraps his body around the female, then the female releases a stream of adhesive eggs into the nest (Ref. 44091 ). In southeast Asia, spawning period is during the rainy season, when rivers rise and fish are able to excavate nests in submerged mud banks and dikes of flooded rice fields (Ref. 40977 ).

Short description : Dorsal spines (total): 2; Dorsal soft rays (total): 6; Anal spines : 0. Diagnosis: recognized by its pointed snout, the rather small mouth, and the width of the premaxillary tooth plate (1/5-1/3.5, usually 1/4, of head length); vomerine dentition represented by a square to rectangular tooth plate which begins to develop at sizes between 60 and 70 mm standard length; palatine dentition developing at sizes over 100 mm standard length, initially as isolated teeth; second or third branched dorsal-fin ray always the longest; upper caudal-fin lobe much longer than lower lobe; gill rakers long and smooth; other characters, such as length of dorsal fin, number of branched rays in anal fin, and number of gill rakers on first gill arch, are subject to intraspecific variations; sexually mature males and (some) ripe females show considerable morphological differences; such specimens have often been labelled as Chrysichthys furcatus ; maturity occurs probably at a rather advanced stage (at over 200 mm SL) and leads to the inflation of head, broadening of mouth and premaxillary tooth plate, shortening of spines and overgrowth of fin-spines by thick skin, the fins becoming more rounded, and the caudal-fin lobes sometimes becoming subequal; the body acquires an emaciated, thinned down appearance (Ref. 57126 , 81642 ). Characters only clear in mature males in reproduction: adipose fin short, base contained 8-11 times in SL and measuring 28-64% of distance between dorsal fin and adipose fin; maxillary barbel not reaching beyond dorsal spine when extended; head swollen; skin mucous; spines thick and covered with skin (Ref. 81642 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Observed from an aquarium, mature males swam around the shelter before spawning, sometimes digging the substrate under the shelter by beating their tail. Although males did not show features of parental care such as fanning or egg-cleaning in an aquarium condition, they continued to tend the shelter and attack other fish introduced to the aquarium. Once a ripe female was introduced to a male aquarium, the male starts to pursue the female, nudging its belly. The female is then led to or visited voluntarily the male shelter. Subsequently, either in the shelter (usually) or outside, the male wraps its body around the head and abdomen of the female, with the female's head against the male's caudal peduncle. The pair remain in this position for 5.2-9.2 seconds (6.1-7.8 seconds on the average for each pair). The female, firmly held by the male's pectoral, pelvic, anal and caudal fins, slowly beats its caudal fin during the embrace. The embrace is terminated by spawning, with the female often turning its abdomen upwards when releasing eggs. Neither conspicuous ejaculatory behavior by the male nor turbidity caused by the semen was observed. Immediately after spawning, the female stirs the eggs by quickly swinging its body, leaves the spawning site afterwards or is chased away by the male. After several minutes, the female either returns voluntarily or is led back by the male to the shelter, repeating the same behavioral pattern all over again. The mean interval between successive spawnings ranged from 1.7-7.0 mins. It was also observed that immediately following spawning, all males were observed to forage for eggs.

Life cycle and mating behavior : The male chooses a nesting site under a rock or ledge. Spawning males are territorial toward other males (Ref. 27547 ). He attracts a female into the nesting site and after more courting the female deposits her adhesive eggs. The female is then driven out and the male guards the eggs until hatching occurs. The nest usually contains eggs from several females (Ref. 27547 ). The male has also been observed to guard the young (Ref. 1998 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males arrive first in shallow waters, establish their territories, and build small nests near the bottom. The male then entices the female to the nest and by prodding her ventral and caudal peduncle area, forces her to release her eggs into the nest. The male then drives the female away, fertilizes the eggs and guards his territory until the young hatch and swim away. Males may build two nests during a breeding season and more than one female may deposit eggs in each nest (Ref. 1998 ). Eggs hatch in 8-9 days (Ref. 59043 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Its reproductive strategies differ from many spring-dwelling pupfishes. Cyprinodon n. amargosae is a group spawner. Males do not establish and defend territories as do males of spring-dwelling subspecies. Instead, a reproductive male usually directs a receptive female to the periphery of the group where spawning occurs, although spawning may even take place in the center of the group (www.death-valley.us).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males construct foam nests and guard the growing larvae until mid-January when the first seasonal rains flood the breeding area, causing the about 10 cm long young eels to disperse (Ref. 40645 ). Males outnumber females (3:1) and are considerably larger than females (Ref. 40645 ). There are three successive batches of eggs deposited in a spawning period.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Spawns 5-7 times in its life, or even 9-10 times for those living 10-14 years. Fecundity varies with geographical region. It decreases from east to west in the European Arctic and from south to north in western Pacific waters. Throughout its distribution area, spawning occurs during January-February in coastal zones of bays and inlets on sand-gravel substrate and in strong tidal currents.

Life cycle and mating behavior : In Australia, fish are males at 24-47 cm FL, hermaphrodites at 25-46 cm FL and females at 28-72 cm FL. On the northeast Queensland coast, most blue threadfin are females by 45-50 cm FL. Hermaphroditic blue threadfin develop fom 1-2-year-old fish, and females first appear as 2-3-year-old individuals (Ref. 28736 ). Male fish probably commence sex reversal immediately after spawning (ie about April-May) and this condition may persist until after the next spawning period (Ref. 28736 ). The progression from hermaphrodites to females is complete by the following season. There is little information on the larvae, although nursery areas are known to be lower estuaries, tidal swamps and lagoons, and shallows along the foreshores (Williams 1997).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Some experts believe that some form of copulation happens during breeding of this species. The female turns on her side to expose her abdomen to the male who then swims against her in a forceful movement. Aftewards, the female takes a rest and deposits her eggs in the sand. This whole activity is presumably repeated one more time (Ref. 205 ). Other experts believe otherwise, that only a simple and simultaneous discharge of gametes happens during breeding (Ref. 205 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Ovoviviparous, without a yolk-sac placenta (Ref. 244 ). Embryos feed solely on yolk (Ref. 50449 ). 6 to 52 young in a litter (Ref. 26346 ). Litter size increases with the size of the mother. Embryos reach 30-36 cm TL at birth (Ref. 6080 ). In the southern waters of Australia, newly born and older juveniles (30-70 cm long) aggregate in 'nursery areas' found in shallow waters.They move to deeper coastal waters to over-winter. The following spring finds most of these young returning to their nursery areas. The older ones, aged 2 years and over move instead to eastern Bass Strait where most of the immature stock are found. The length of an average full-term embryo is 32 cm. Spawning frequency is once every year, ovulation occurring in early summer and parturition is completed by January of the following year. Gestation period lasts for about 12 months (Ref. 6390 , 6871 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Pelagic spawner. Females migrate to spawning sites, larger females travel long distances to downcurrent areas than smaller ones to protect the eggs from becoming prey to larger reef fishes (Ref. 32198 ). Spawning sites are chosen by the females irregardless of the males occupying them (Ref. 32198 ). Females spawn in more than one spawning site, each site occupied by more than one male, which are either territorial or non-territorial (Ref. 32198 ). After spawning, they return individually to their home ranges without passing through other spawning sites (Ref. 32198 ). Some females on the other hand change sex after spawning (Ref. 32198 ). As males, they begin to establish territories in the spawning sites, even to those they visited before the sex change (Ref. 32198 ). This observation support the suggestion (Warner's 1985, 1986) that females stored information on spawning sites by migrating to various sites which aided in the acquisition of a mating territory after changing sex (Ref. 32198 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Sexually mature fish migrate upstream into smaller and shallower (0.3-1.5 m deep) streams (Ref. 26170 ), usually in upper reaches of tributaries (Ref. 59043 ). Males arrive first at spawning sites. Males defend females against other individuals. Spawning usually occurs during daytime (Ref. 59043 ). Spawns on gravelly bottom where female makes a shallow hole where the eggs are laid and covered with gravel (Ref. 682 ). Both sexes covered the eggs with substrate. They both defend the spawning site up to 2 weeks after spawning. Eggs usually hatch after 25-40 days. Larvae stay in gravel until yolk sac is absorbed after 8-14 days (Ref. 59043 ). Young remain near spawning area feeding on bottom fauna. Spawns with snow melt, in shallow water in Danube or affluents (Ref. 682 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : In Australia, spawning appears to be correlated with water temperature and nutrient upwellings (Ref. 7129 ). It appears that mature fish move up the continental slope into shallow depths (320-400 m) and aggregate in specific grounds for spawning (Ref. 6390 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Seems to spawn throughout the year in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific with peak spawning occurring in the respective local summer seasons. Spawning occurs with males and females swimming in pairs or with two or three males chasing a single female (probably a mating behavior). The ripe ovarian eggs are about 0.85 mm in diameter and have a single oil globule; there are no structures on the vitalize membrane and the egg is transparent. Eggs shed from captured female in the Indian Ocean averaged 1.304 mm in diameter.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males care for the eggs (Ref. 57667 ). Lays up to 100 eggs in the aquarium (Ref. 7020 ). The male does a 'T-dance' with a receptive female and the female lays her eggs over algal-covered rocks where they adhere by their sticky thread. In the laboratory, this was simulated by using a green orlon wool wrapped glass plate - males will continuously guard the eggs on this, fanning with their fins to keep eggs clean and aerated (D. Holdway, pers. com 2006).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Breeds in flowing water therefore must ascend the rivers to spawn in gravel beds. Eggs are laid in a shallow saucer-like nest which is constructed in the gravel by a female (or perhaps male) using the snout and caudal fin. Eggs are covered with gravel after fertilization. A 45 cm female carries 30, 000 eggs.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males build the nest on very shallow waters near the shore. The pair then swims in a circular path over the nest and eggs and sperm is released in intervals. The male guards the eggs for about 7 days (Ref. 93240 ) and the young (to about 11 days after hatching), then prepares the nest for another spawning with the same or different females (Ref. 1998 ). In European waters, each male may spawn with several females in one nest and guard the nest until abandoned by larvae (Ref. 59043 ). Produces up to 1000 eggs (Ref. 1672 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Breeding pairs were observed on gravel patches behind rocks in 30-60 cm of water. The following account of mating behaviour comes from (Ref. 36980 ): 'In a typical behavior pattern, 5-10 males were observed following a gravid female..Once the female had selected a suitable spawning site, she would dig head first into the gravel with violent thrashing movements. After two or three attempts, females usually became half buried in the gravel with only head and pectoral fins exposed. During this activity attending males began making rapid darting movements around the female. The attending males moved closer to the buried female until one male, usually the largest, positioned himself beside or over her. Occasionally an even larger male would enter an area and replace the attendant male. After a male had remained with a buried female for a few minutes, he began to aggressively defend a territory. Other males that came within about 20 cm of the female were quickly chased away. In the absence of other males, the attendant male began courtship behavior by darting rapidly around the female, nudging her with his snout and perching along side or on top of her. Courtship lasted up to 30 min. Then the female began a series of rapid quivering movements followed by, or concurrent with, trembling movements by the male. It was assumed that the rapid vibrating movements of the female and male, lasting about 5 sec., indicated deposition of eggs and release of sperm. A female remained buried in the same spot during a series of 3-5 quiverings over a period of nearly 5 min. About 10 min after spawning, both fish moved away from the nest and egg guarding was not observed by either sex.' Eggs are buried under small gravel and pebbles (Ref. 36980 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Breeds in summer (Ref. 2 , 7248 , 52193 ). The reproductive season lasts from September to March in the southern regions of the species distribution (Ref. 52307 ). Males construct (Ref. 2 , 13337 ) and defend (Ref. 2 ) a nest in shallowish waters (Ref. 2 , 13337 ), which is a central volcano-shaped mound (Ref. 2 , 314 , 364 , 5214 , 13337 , 55074 ) with a flat or slightly concave top which is the mating platform, surrounded by a ditch and vallum (groove and boundary wall) (Ref. 2 ). The cone is higher than the boundary wall of the territory (Ref. 2 ). Spawns in waters up to 150 (Ref. 2 ) or 300 (Ref. 52307 ) cm deep, along banks of the lakes/river (Ref. 2 ). Males court several females in succession and females may mate with more than one male in a summer, so that large populations of young may build up (Ref. 5214 , 52307 ). Several nests are often grouped into an arena (Ref. 5214 , 7248 , 36094 , 52193 ). If a male can successfully attract a female to his pit, both fish will swim to the center of the nest; the female then deposits her eggs - about 10-50 per spawn - and the male, possessing tassel-like genital papilla approximately 25 mm in length, swims over the eggs; the female touches the male's tassels with her lips, stimulating him to fertilize the eggs; surely part of the sperm will fertilize the eggs in the female's mouth, but the majority of the fertilization takes place outside, in the crater of the nest; Wickler (1966) wrote that he observed a spermatophore-like structure in this species but Trewavas (1983) wrote that it was more likely a filament of the genital papilla, as she did not observe any spermatophores in this species under natural conditions; pair-bonding does not take place, as partners are only together during spawning; in the wlld, females have been observed spawning with one male and then seeking others out to continue spawning with, in the end brooding some eggs from each; depending on its size, a female can carry up to 1300 eggs in her mouth; eggs have a diameter of 3 mm and are greenish-brown in color; a female can raise multiple broods per season, at about 5·week intervals; brooding females prefer to hide in regions with thick vegetation and cover; fry may initially leave the mother's mouth even before yolk sack is totally absorbed, but remain close together and are reincubated by the mother at night or when threatened; after about 21 days, the babies (about 20 mm long) leave their mother; they spend their earliest days in the shallow waters near the banks, or in other regions that contain plenty of shelter; once they increase in size, they will begin to venture out into more open water (Ref. 52307 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : A maternal mouthbrooder; males defend territories from shallow water down to at least 28m; males dig pits, which are sometimes huge craters with a small raised platform of fine sand (Ref. 118638 ). Breeding period extends over several months as noted in Lake Malombe, at present one of the main breeding areas for this species (Ref. 6150 ). Males build nests on a variety of substrata and at depths of 0.5m to at least 28m; nests generally 0.3-1.9m diameter, with dimensions correlated to male size (Ref. 55079 ). Nest with a characteristic spawning cone in its center (Ref. 5595 ). Courtship appears to occur mainly in the early morning (Ref. 40193 , 55079 ), and consist of leading, followed by tilting and head-down quivering if the female follows the male to the nest (Ref. 40193 ). A female with 324 young of 15mm long in the mouth has been caught (Ref. 2781 ). Females keep guarding their fry until they are about 24 mm (Ref. 2781 , 6150 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Seems to be sexually mature at a smaller size in Lakes Chungruru and Kingiri than in Lake Malawi (Ref. 2 , 54852 ). Spawns off clean sandy or rocky shores (Ref. 2 , 87 , 2781 ) in deeper water (Ref. 2 , 87 , 2781 , 5595 , 6150 , 40193 ). Territorial males build a large (Ref. 5595 , 40193 , 55079 ) sand-castle nest, with a characteristic spawning cone in its center (Ref. 2 , 5595 ). Females congregate in schools that may number hundreds of individuals (Ref. 2 , 2781 , 5595 ). The male genital tassel, which develops together with the breeding dress and imitates a clutch of eggs, is dragged through the nest after the females has deposited some eggs, which are picked up immediately; the female probably mistakes the tassel for eggs that have been forgotten and tries to collect them as well, which results in the eggs being fertilized (Ref. 5595 ). Females carrying eggs in the mouth move into open, more eutrophic waters, and stay there until the young have almost lost the yolk sac; they feed little during this time (Ref. 2 781). Females brood eggs/young, guarding their fry until about 52(-58)mm (Ref. 2 , 2781 ). Females move inshore with their young for at least part of the day; the young are spat out to feed, and food (small phytoplankton) is found in the foregut before the involuted yolk-sac is fully absorbed (Ref. 2 781).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Spawns at the edge of the littoral terrace of lakes (Ref. 1 , 2 , 87 , 6465 ), in sandy or muddy bottoms (Ref. 57425 ). Displays a lek mating system; territorial males establish breeding territories where they dig spawning pits, assume a dark coloration, defend a breeding territory and actively court females; sneaking males intrude into nests during a spawning episode, exhibiting quivering behavior which is usually an indicator of sperm release; sneaking is predominantly performed by subordinate males, which may adopt pseudo-female behavior (Ref. 57425 ). Only territorial males produce sounds, during all phases of courtship but especially during the late stages, including spawning (Ref. 49830 ). Territorial male excavates and defends a basin-shaped pit in the center of his territory, where female deposits 100-1700(1800) eggs (Ref. 44894 , 52307 ). Eggs and milt are sucked up by the female (Ref. 2 , 44894 ). Fertilization is reported to sometimes occur in the mouth of the female (Ref. 6028 ). Females incubate eggs alone (Ref. 1 2501, 52307 ). It is possible, albeit rare, that males take up some eggs after spawning (Ref. 2 , 5726 , 52307 , 57895 ), but they almost always eat them soon after (Ref. 52307 ). Females school together while mouthbrooding (Ref. 40035 ), they cease to feed and subsist on food reserves stored in their body (Ref. 1 ). Females may spawn a full clutch with just one male, or may spawn with several different males in a series (Ref. 52307 ). Water is circulated over the eggs by chewing movements of the jaws (Ref. 1 2501, 12522 ). Fry hatch in the female's mouth after 3-5 days (Ref. 2 , 12501 , 12522 , 44894 , 52307 ), depending on the temperature (Ref. 52307 ). The young are released from the mouth in 10-14 days, but remain near the female and enter the mouth if threatened until about 3 weeks old (Ref. 2 , 44894 , 52307 ). Fry and juveniles shoal in shallow water (Ref. 6465 , 7248 , 57895 ) where they feed during the day, and retreat to deep water at night (Ref. 87 , 6465 ). Females raise multiple broods during a season (Ref. 7248 , 57895 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Spawning did not occur in ponds at a temperature below 21°C (Ref. 2 ). Rarely more than one brood in a season (Ref. 87 , 246 ), but known to breed at least twice a year under pond conditions (Ref. 12524 , 13337 ). Males excavate saucer-shaped nests (Ref. 2 46, 314 , 6465 , 12524 , 13337 , 54048 ) that can be up to 75cm in diameter and 30cm deep, using mouth and fins (Ref. 2 , 314 , 52307 ), in the center of their territory (Ref. 52307 ), on a sandy substrate (any vegetation is uprooted with its mouth) and in water from 1-3m deep, where they display to attract females (Ref. 12524 , 13337 , 54048 ). Up to 40 nests can be found together (Ref. 6465 ). Females are the primary care-givers (Ref. 52307 ), moutbrooding eggs, larvae and fry; multiple broods are raised during the warmer months (Ref. 7248 , 52193 ). She lays her eggs in the concavity on top of the nest, the male fertilizes the eggs whereupon the female takes the eggs into her mouth where they are incubated; males guard the nest and females against all intruders; parental care is exercised for the first few weeks after the eggs hatch (Ref. 12524 , 13337 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Enters freshwater during advanced stage of sexual development and spawning occurs almost immediately (Ref. 1998 ). Spawning occurs at depths of ~3 meters, current speeds of ~20cm/sec. near the head waters over sand and pebbles at 4-11° C water temperature. At spawning time the female excavates a hole of around 1 meter diameter and 50 cm depth before spawning can occur (Ref. 12218 ). Nest building is done by the female by lying on one side and lashing its tail to displace the sand and silt on the river bed. The pair then settles in the nest, mouths gape, and with rapid vibration of the pair, eggs and milt are released. The female then covers the nest. Males are aggressive and may spawn with different females; females likewise may spawn with other males and therefore builds different nests. Adults die after a week (Ref. 1998 ). A fish spawns 700-7,000 eggs in two to three egg releases. Eggs are ~300-3,500 per spawn. Egg size is ~6.7 mm, water temp. is 8-10°C at 60 days before hatching. Larva size is around 16 mm. Come springtime the juveniles go to the ocean and come back 3-4 years later to their exact birthplace. This fish reaches maturity in 2-4 years. Larvae are found around the spawning site, Juveniles are found around the coast. Juveniles migrate to the ocean at ~27-45 mm during February at water temperatures around 4° C (Ref. 12218 ). Reproductive strategy: synchronous ovarian organization, determinate fecundity (Ref. 51846 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adults develop secondary sexual characteristics during their upstream migration (Ref. 1998 ), which occurs any time from June to late September, depending on location (Ref. 27547 ). Male develop a humpback, an enlarged head and large teeth on both jaws that form a pronounced hooked type (Ref. 59043 ). The upstream run seems to be triggered by high water (Ref. 27547 ). Female builds the redd by lying on one side and using its tail, it displaces silt and light gravel to produce a deep trough. Male spends most of the time driving off intruding males. When the redd is completed, the female drops into it, followed immediately by the male. They open their mouths, vibrate and release eggs and sperm. In some cases, several males spawn with a single female. The eggs are then covered as the female digs a new redd at the upstream edge of the previous one. Adults live up to a few weeks after spawning before they die (Ref. 1998 , 27547 ). Reported to die 10-20 days after spawning (Ref. 59043 ). About 1200-1800 eggs are laid. After hatching and the yellow egg yolk is absorbed, if the hatchling doesn't have a parr mark they go to the ocean and come again to the same birthplace stream the next year during spring after growing for 16-18 months. Survival rates are low, at 1-25% (taken from a Canadian river) (Ref. 12218 ). Reproductive strategy: synchronous ovarian organization, determinate fecundity (Ref. 51846 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adult sockeyes return to natal streams to spawn. This occurs during summer and fall and as late as December in the southern part of the range. The female selects a site, usually with gravel bottom, and digs a nest. During nest building, the female is attended by a dominant male and a few subordinate males. At this stage, females tend to be aggressive toward other females and subordinate males; males are aggressive toward other males. Between digging acts, the female will rest over the pit while the dominant male courts her. Once the nest is completed, the female enters the nest, followed immediately by the dominant male who comes close beside her. Their mouths gape, and the pair vibrates to release eggs and sperm. One or more subordinate males may come to the other side of the female and join in the spawning. The female then moves to the upstream edge of the nest and digs again, covering the old nest, at the same time creating a new one just upstream from the previous one. A female normally needs 3 to 5 days to deposit all her eggs and utilizes 3 to 5 nests for this purpose. She may spawn with several dominant males. A male may breed with several females. All adult sockeye die after spawning (Ref. 27547 ). Reproductive strategy: synchronous ovarian organization, determinate fecundity (Ref. 51846 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Nesting usually in shallow water weedy areas (Ref. 96 ). Males establish territory and dig a spawning pit (Ref. 2 , 6465 , 54601 ), using mouth and fins (Ref. 2 ), up to 60cm deep and 4-6m in diameter; a number of territories can often be found clustered together (Ref. 52307 ). Territories are defended by means of agressive behaviour (Ref. 6465 ), including lateral display, lateral biting and mouth-to-mouth combat (Ref. 2 ). Reproduction is stimulated by long photoperiods and inhibited by short daylengths (Ref. 54365 ). Reproduction requires a minimum temperature of about 20°C (Ref. 2 ). Males visit schools of females and attempt to attract a female spawning partner (Ref. 2 , 52307 ). Courting behaviour in the nest consists of lateral display by both sexes with nipping and tail-flapping (Ref. 2 ). Eggs are deposited in single clutches, from several dozen to 100 eggs (Ref. 52307 ), and are taken into the females mouth as soon as they are fertilized (Ref. 2 , 6465 , 52307 ), with a peak spawning frequency around the 9-11th hour of light (Ref. 31140 , 54365 ). One female may hold up to 2000 eggs in her mouth (Ref. 2 ). The female swims away to deeper water with the brood after spawning is complete (Ref. 2 , 52307 ), while the male renews spawning activities with another female. Hatching occurs about 3 days after oviposition (Ref. 2 ). Incubation time varies with temperature, 13-14 days at 25-27°C (Ref. 2 , 52307 ) or 8-10 days at 29°C (Ref. 144 ), and juveniles leave the mother's mouth when they are about 1.1cm in length (Ref. 54601 ). The young school near parent's head for a few days, reentering the mouth at any sign of danger or at a gesture of the female; parent-offspring relationship ceases after 5 days (Ref. 2 ).

Oreochromis esculentus differs from O. niloticus as follows: no vertical stripes on the caudal fin; lower numbers of soft dorsal rays and therefore of total dorsal rays; lower modal number of lower gill-rakers; finer teeth in jaws and pharynx; a longer lower pharyngeal bone, 33.0-35.5% length of head; caudal peduncle as long as or, usually, longer than deep; O. niloticus , in common with many other species, is often preserved with three or four midlateral spots and another on the top of the caudal peduncle, a pattern not found in O. esculentus ; and male genital papilla opening between a pair of often spongy lobes, vs. papilla conical or with a slight distal notch in O. niloticus (Ref. 2 ). Body shape ( shape guide ): fusiform / normal.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Reproduction probably triggered by the rains (Ref. 2771 ), with the time of maximum spawning activity coinciding with the wettest months of the year (Ref. 363 ). Males form a crater-like spawning nest without a distinct wall (Ref. 27292 ). The pit is about 30cm in diameter and 10cm deep, and is probably made in the early morning (Ref. 27292 ). Ovaries show that a female may have a succession of three or more broods in a spawning period; brooding females often shelter in weed beds and swampy places (Ref. 2 , 363 ). Males defend their breeding territory (Ref. 2 ) for weeks or on and off for several months, while females only make short visits to the spawning grounds and leave the territory immediately after spawning (Ref. 363 ). Males eat little while actively guarding the nest (Ref. 363 ). Papyrus swamp channels (Ref. 363 , 34921 , 55020 ) and beaches with weed grown swamps (Ref. 34921 ) function as nursery areas. Young become independent at a length of about 1.5cm (Ref. 2 , 363 )by which size the yolk sac is occluded and they have strated to feed (Ref. 363 ), and at about 12cm TL they move from the nursery areas to the open water (Ref. 2 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Rainbow smelt usually return to natal streams to spawn but degree of homing varies from one population to another and may be genetically controlled (Ref. 11226 , 30367 ). Movement into the streams begins when water temperatures reach 2° to 4°C or higher. The upstream run is generally short, at most a few km (Ref. 11226 , 28996 ). Movement to spawning grounds are usually made at night. Males reach spawning grounds an hour or so before the females. Spawning is initiated, at least in part, by the presence of the proper sex ratio in the group, which has been indicated to be no more than four males to one female (Ref. 30366 , 30374 ). The spawning group crowd together and move upstream. Body contact between a male and female brings about a release of sperm and eggs. Only a few eggs are extruded at each spawning act (Ref. 30366 ), so that the act is repeated over several hours each night for several nights until all eggs are extruded. After each evening's activities, most drift downstream to the larger body of water whence they came to the spawning grounds. Some, mostly males, may remain in the spawning stream during the day. Many spawned-out fish, especially males, die after spawning, but those that survive will spawn again the following year (Ref. 27547 ). Lake shore spawners on the other hand move inshore in small schools and swim about over rather restricted areas, apparently without any distinct pairing. The composition of the schools change constantly, for individual fish apparently engage in spawning activities for only 15 to 30 minutes at a time, then leave the school (Ref. 30374 , 30376 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : While in captivity, males exhibit tail-beating while infront of a large female aside from color changes as prespawning behavior (Ref. 69400 ). 'The generalized condition of a midventral row of specialized scales suggests that the male mounts the female and aligns his body with hers during fertilization and deposition of the eggs' (Ref. 69400 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : In Polypterus senegalus courtship starts with a series of leaps from the surface by usually only one of the pair at a time, followed by a slow descent through the water; after a while the male stays very close to the female and at times the female will remain motionless in the water and the male will come up to her from behind and nudge her with sidewise movements of his head; the enlarged and swollen anal fin of the male is folded in a cup-like fashion and is used to brush the female (Ref. 42791 ). No nest is constructed, but the eggs are laid a few at a time throughout the thick vegetation (Ref. 42791 ). The larvae, which move about with the male parent in a dense school, are provided with accessory gills and appear very salamander-like (Ref. 42791 ).

Short description : Dorsal spines (total): 6 - 12; Dorsal soft rays (total): 9 - 13; Anal spines : 1; Anal soft rays : 8 - 13; Vertebrae : 30 - 35. Distinguished uniquely from congeners in Europe by having scutes on side of caudal peduncle, forming a keel. Differs further from other members of the genus in Europe by the combination of the following characters: flank lacking scutes; dorsal fin with 7-11 spines; and caudal peduncle wider than deep (Ref. 59043 ). Distinguished by the presence of 7 to 12 free spines in front of the dorsal fin and a long caudal keel that usually reaches beneath the dorsal fin (Ref. 27547 ). Dorsal spines separated from one another, each with a rudimentary membrane on its posterior side; anal spine stout and curved; posterior edge of pectorals rounded; pelvic ray pressed close to the spine; caudal fin usually truncate, varying from slightly indented to slightly rounded (Ref. 27547 ). Pale green, grey, or olive above, strongly pigmented with irregularly arranged dark bars or blotches; silvery below (Ref. 1998 ). Fins colorless (Ref. 27547 ). Breeding colors may be variable, depending on sex, population and stage of breeding cycle but color of females always less intense than those of males (Ref. 27547 ). Aggressive females become dark on the back and paler below, then sometimes become paler with more conspicuous saddle marks as actual breeding approaches (Ref. 30380 ). Aggressive males become totally black except for the colorless fins and the membranes on the pelvic spines, which are white. At breeding, the males become paler on the back and more intensely black on the belly, especially under the chin (Ref. 28993 , 30380 ). Breeding males on the east coast of North America have been reported as reddish under the head and greenish on the belly (Ref. 27547 ). Caudal fin with 12 rays (Ref. 2196 ). Body shape ( shape guide ): elongated.

Life cycle and mating behavior : During the spawning season, both males and females set up territories which are defended against intruders of either sex. The male builds the nest with plant fragments and binds it together with a kidney secretion. The nest has two openings. The male then entices the female into the nest with quick dancing movements. An enticed female follows the male to his nest, enters it through one opening, deposits 50 to 80 eggs, then leaves through the other opening (Ref. 1998 , 27547 ). In nests with one opening, the female enters, turns around, deposits her eggs and leaves (Ref. 27547 ). The male then enters the nest and fertilizes the eggs as it swims toward the other opening. More than one female may deposit eggs to the nest. The male guards one opening and aerates the eggs (Ref. 1998 ). Soon after releasing a clutch of eggs, a female feeds voraciously and in a day or so, is ready to be courted again (Ref. 27547 ). Sometimes the nest falls apart before the eggs hatch. The male may build a new nest nearby and transfer the eggs to it. At hatching, the male enters the nest to remove egg remains. Newly hatched larvae move to the top of the nest and settle on it. The male may construct a nursery above the nest. As the larvae become more active, the male catches them in his mouth and spits them back to the nest or nursery. As the larvae become more active, the male loses interest in them, and may build a new nest and repeat the process or the breeding season ends (Ref. 28993 ). Eggs hatch in 6-7 days (Ref. 59043 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Hides eggs in live invertebrates such as mussels, crabs or ascidians. The female develops a conduit ovipositor by which it deposits its ovules between the gills of the bivalve. The male then comes to deposit its seed close to the respiratory opening of the bivalve; at the interior of which fertilization takes place. The male keeps the eggs and alevins until they leave the refuge. In exchange, the fish rids the bivalve of its parasites (Ref. 30578 ). The young leave the mussel about 28 days after hatching, having reached a length of about 10 mm (Ref. 41678 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males and females appear externally alike (Refs. 2279 & 9245). In ' Serrasalmus sp. aff. nattereri ', reported to occur in the Orinoco basin (Venezuela, Guyana), the males have more 'bull-like' heads, but are more slender than females (Ref. 1672 ). Eggs are laid on tree roots trailing in the water and are guarded; the reproductive success may vary strongly from year to year depending on how the savanna was flooded (Ref. 9078 ). The eggs are large, adhere to plants and are not attacked by the parents. They hatch in 9 to10 days (Ref. 7020 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males are generally territorial but when females start showing spawning behavior, males pair up with females and lose interest in their territories. Spawning takes place at almost any time of the day. A female invades a males territory and finds a suitable spot for a redd. Once a spot has been selected, she starts digging. While the female is digging, the male courts her by circling around her and then gliding along her side and quivering. When the redd is completed, the pair release egg and sperm. The pair then swim forward out of the nest, often still ejecting sex products. This may be repeated up to 5 times before the female begins to cover the eggs. The female then digs at the edge of the pit, covering the eggs and beginning the next redd (Ref. 27547 ). Males often mate with more than one female, taking the second mate after the first has exhausted the eggs. Sometimes, a female will mate successively with two or more males (Ref. 28968 , 28969 ). Several days are usually required for females to deposit all their eggs (Ref. 27547 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Ovarian development probably of the group-synchronous type. Fecundity is determinate based on release of great majority of oocytes in a given spawning season, few signs of atretic oocytes and oocyte diameter distribution points to lack of substantial production of new oocytes (Ref. 51971 ). Spawn on rock and gravel. Larvae benthic (Ref. 7471 ). According to a study (Ref. 10280 ), although no nest is built, a territory is established and one parent guards the nest. In Manitoba, females lay 200-1200 transparent eggs hatching in 7-10 days at 15.6°C. Young are pelagic and inhabit quiet waters inshore; pelagic stage lasts 4 months before typical bottom dwelling existence of adults commence (Ref 1998). Spawn in riffles over gravelly bottom near nest of river chub.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Oviparous (Ref. 265 ). In the Gulf of California, some individuals spawn in their first year, but most in their second (Ref. 188 ). In Australia (as S. neopilchardus ), this species breeds in spring and summer in southern part of range, and in summer and autumn in northern part, apparently related to seasonal movement of the limiting 14°C and 21°C isotherms, then autumn to early spring (Ref. 6390 ). It was believed that individual Australian pilchards only spawn once or twice in a season (Ref. 26422 , 26424 ), but research on related species suggests that they may spawn a number of times (Ref. 6882 ). Batch fecundities range from about 10,000 eggs in 13 cm long females to about 45,000 eggs in females of about 18 cm (Ref. 26420 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adults from the sea and lakes enter rivers to spawn. A female selects a nest site and begins to dig a redd while the male continues to court her and drive away intruding males. Upon completion of the redd, both drop into it and release eggs and sperm. This may be repeated several times before the eggs are covered by the female who swims along the edge of the of the redd, sweeping small pebbles and other particles into it with her tail and anal fin. Later, she may dig again and further cover the eggs while preparing a new nest (Ref. 27547 ). Breeding is an annual event for southern populations; occurring every second or third year in the Arctic (Ref. 27547 ). Males and females reportedly die after spawning (Ref. 12218 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : The spawning act occurs mostly at night, with peak activity between dusk and 9 or 10 pm (Ref. 28805 , 28815 ). During the day the fish are more or less dispersed away from the spawning beds but return in considerable numbers in the late afternoon (Ref. 27547 ). Males reach spawning beds first and spend some time cleaning the rocks. Females arrive a few days later and are courted by the males. During and following courtship, the males attempt to spawn with the females. One or two males approach a female, press against her sides and quiver. The eggs fall into the crevices and the spawners disperse. The act is repeated until the female releases all her eggs (Ref. 1998 , 27547 ). On occasion, as many as seven males and three females may engage in a mass spawning act (Ref. 28815 ). Spawning occurs annually in southern areas, every other year in Great Slave Lake, Northwest Terrritories, and only every other year in Great Bear and some other lakes of the arctic (Ref. 1153 , 28802 , 28860 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Courtship begins with a male attempting to drive a female toward suitable spawning gravel. A receptive female chooses a spot and digs a redd. While the female is digging, the male continues courtship activity, darting alongside the female and quivering, swimming over and under her and rubbing her with his fins; most of the time however, is spent driving off other males. When the redd is completed, the pair enter the nest and deposit eggs and milt. After spawning the female covers the eggs by sweeping small pebbles at the downstream edge of the redd upstream. Once the eggs are completely covered, she moves to the upstream end of the redd and begins digging a new redd (Ref. 27547 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Spawns at the edge of the littoral terrace of lakes (Ref. 1 , 2 , 87 , 6465 ), in sandy or muddy bottoms (Ref. 57425 ). Displays a lek mating system; territorial males establish breeding territories where they dig spawning pits, assume a dark coloration, defend a breeding territory and actively court females; sneaking males intrude into nests during a spawning episode, exhibiting quivering behavior which is usually an indicator of sperm release; sneaking is predominantly performed by subordinate males, which may adopt pseudo-female behavior (Ref. 57425 ). Only territorial males produce sounds, during all phases of courtship but especially during the late stages, including spawning (Ref. 49830 ). Territorial male excavates and defends a basin-shaped pit in the center of his territory, where female deposits 100-1700(1800) eggs (Ref. 44894 , 52307 ). Eggs and milt are sucked up by the female (Ref. 2 , 44894 ). Fertilization is reported to sometimes occur in the mouth of the female (Ref. 6028 ). Females incubate eggs alone (Ref. 1 2501, 52307 ). It is possible, albeit rare, that males take up some eggs after spawning (Ref. 2 , 5726 , 52307 , 57895 ), but they almost always eat them soon after (Ref. 52307 ). Females school together while mouthbrooding (Ref. 40035 ), they cease to feed and subsist on food reserves stored in their body (Ref. 1 ). Females may spawn a full clutch with just one male, or may spawn with several different males in a series (Ref. 52307 ). Water is circulated over the eggs by chewing movements of the jaws (Ref. 1 2501, 12522 ). Fry hatch in the female's mouth after 3-5 days (Ref. 2 , 12501 , 12522 , 44894 , 52307 ), depending on the temperature (Ref. 52307 ). The young are released from the mouth in 10-14 days, but remain near the female and enter the mouth if threatened until about 3 weeks old (Ref. 2 , 44894 , 52307 ). Fry and juveniles shoal in shallow water (Ref. 6465 , 7248 , 57895 ) where they feed during the day, and retreat to deep water at night (Ref. 87 , 6465 ). Females raise multiple broods during a season (Ref. 7248 , 57895 ).

In Central and East Africa populations without as well as with entirely developed adipose fin occur; in several populations both morphotypes are mixed together, the adipose fin being absent or present but sometimes varying in size from a recognizable protrusion low down the back to a fully developed adipose fin; posterior nostrils always closer to each other than are anterior ones; lower jaw reaches beyond snout but hardly remarkable in some specimens, mouth being almost isognath; inner side of pectoral spine feebly serrated; nasal barbel at least reaching to midway between eye and opercle but often reaching beyond this level; small specimens (up to about 15 cm) with typical colour pattern with dark lateral bands along sides and anal fin, this pattern gradually disappearsing in larger specimens, the body becoming in general entirely brownish, yellowish and silvery with very few traces of dark lateral bands (Ref. 43912 ). Eyes positioned laterally (Ref. 81643 ). Body shape ( shape guide ): fusiform / normal; Cross section: compressed.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Males established territories ranging from 12 to 70 sq. m; initiated courtship when females approached the territories; lateral display, rushing and turning movements were frequently observed during courtship. Mating pair formed about 30 min before copulation; the pair ascended to 1.5-2.0 m above bottom then males suddenly coiled around the body of females to copulate.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Male digs a pit in the stream bottom by removing mouthful of gravel, guards the pit and attempts to attract females. Spawning occurs over the pit. Male guards the nest from intruders. As eggs are deposited in the pit, the male covers them with stones and excavates another pit immediately downstream. As spawning continues and the male covers the eggs, a long ridge of gravel develops.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Upstream migration from wintering areas begins at ice break-up. Early upstream movement may be associated with feeding, but movement soon becomes a definite migration to the spawning area. Spawning begins at dusk, and continuing well into the night. A female accompanied by a male, swims to the surface near the upstream end of the spawning ground. She rapidly moves across the current, extruding her eggs. The male, stays below the female so that as the eggs sink, sperm released, fertilizes the eggs. After completing a spawning pass, the female drifts downstream. She may repeat the spawning act over the downstream portion of the spawning area or may move upstream to the head of the grounds before releasing more eggs. Following spawning, there is a fairly rapid downstream migration to wintering grounds (Ref. 27547 ). It is not certain if spawning occurs annually or at longer intervals (Ref. 27547 ). Russian fish appear to spawn only every third or fourth year (Ref. 28219 ). Spawning frequency at Selawik, Alaska may be every other year (Ref. 27547 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Breeds mainly in rivers, upstream to about 50 km or even over 1000 km as in the Ganges (younger fishes may breed in the tidal zone of rivers). In some rivers the migration is restricted by barrages; there is some evidence that hilsa far up the Ganges and other large rivers, although migrating upstream to spawn, are permanent river populations that do not descend to the sea. The main breeding season is during the southwest monsoon, with a shorter season from January to February or March.

Life cycle and mating behavior : Cold water temperatures during the winter months are necessary for proper ova development (Ref. 44091 ). Spawning takes place in shallow water among weeds, often where willow roots grow exposed in water (Ref. 39171 ), also meadows inundated by spring flood (Ref. 39176 ). Spawning activity begin just before dawn (Ref. 39168 ), to midafternoon (Ref. 39177 ). Individual fish spawn 3-10 lots of eggs at intervals of 8-10 days (Ref. 39180 ). Juveniles need high temperature to grow. Eggs are sticky, attached to water plants or submerged objects (Ref. 59043 ). Females spawn multiple times during the spawning period (Ref. 88808 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adults make regular seasonal migrations associated with spawning. They move downstream to estuaries or at least to lower reaches of rivers in the spring, mostly at night (Ref. 27547 ). Eggs are deposited on the undersurface of a rock, in adhesive masses (Ref. 1998 ). Over 7,000 eggs have been found in a single nest, suggesting that a male may spawn with several females (Ref. 1998 , 27547 ). The male guards the nest until all eggs have hatched (Ref. 1998 , 27547 ). A reverse, upstream migration of yearlings and adults occur in late summer to early winter, from August to December (Ref. 27547 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Breeding pairs were observed on gravel patches behind rocks in 30-60 cm of water. The following account of mating behaviour comes from (Ref. 36980 ): 'In a typical behavior pattern, 5-10 males were observed following a gravid female..Once the female had selected a suitable spawning site, she would dig head first into the gravel with violent thrashing movements. After two or three attempts, females usually became half buried in the gravel with only head and pectoral fins exposed. During this activity attending males began making rapid darting movements around the female. The attending males moved closer to the buried female until one male, usually the largest, positioned himself beside or over her. Occasionally an even larger male would enter an area and replace the attendant male. After a male had remained with a buried female for a few minutes, he began to aggressively defend a territory. Other males that came within about 20 cm of the female were quickly chased away. In the absence of other males, the attendant male began courtship behavior by darting rapidly around the female, nudging her with his snout and perching along side or on top of her. Courtship lasted up to 30 min. Then the female began a series of rapid quivering movements followed by, or concurrent with, trembling movements by the male. It was assumed that the rapid vibrating movements of the female and male, lasting about 5 sec., indicated deposition of eggs and release of sperm. A female remained buried in the same spot during a series of 3-5 quiverings over a period of nearly 5 min. About 10 min after spawning, both fish moved away from the nest and egg guarding was not observed by either sex.' Eggs are buried under small gravel and pebbles (Ref. 36980 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Adults migrate from the sea or lake, school at mouths of rivers, and move upstream when rains increase river flow (Ref. 1998 ). As a rule, the winter entries (December and January) occur in the southern part of the range, with appearance in fresh water becoming progressively earlier to the north (Ref. 30381 , 30382 , 30383 ). At the spawning area, the female finds a spot and digs a pitt. At this point she is aggressive toward other females. While digging, an attendant male courts her or is busy driving away other males. As soon as the pitt is completed, the female drops into it and is immediately followed by the male. The pair are side by side, they open their mouth, quiver and release egg and sperm (Ref. 27547 ). At this point, other males move in and release sperm into the nest (Ref. 1998 ). The female quickly moves to the upstream edge of the nest and starts digging a new pitt, covering the eggs. The whole process is repeated for several days until the female deposits all her eggs. The male then leaves and may seek another female. The spent female usually continues to dig, until she dies (Ref. 27547 ). Reproductive strategy: synchronous ovarian organization, determinate fecundity (Ref. 51846 ).

Life cycle and mating behavior : Nest a saucer-shaped depression with a raised mound in the middle (Ref. 12524 , 13337 ), made by the male in a breeding arena in shallow water down to about 4m (Ref. 54048 ). Females are lured to these through male courtship displays; female collects eggs in mouth after spawning and fertilisation, and moves off; mouthbrooding females may shoal together and do not feed at this time; eggs hatch after about ten days but remain in the mouth for a further few days; juveniles make short feeding sorties once the storage yolk is used up, but seldom stray far and dart into her mouth when danger threatens; after about another 10 days young are released in warm shallow water in the margins (nursery areas), where they feed independently in small shoals (Ref. 54048 ). Young released from mouthbrooding female are about 1cm long (Ref. 2 ). Female returns to the breeding arena where she spawns again (Ref. 54048 ).
