Hydrolagus_colliei,"['The spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) is a chimaera found in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean.

While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths in the northern part of its range.  The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words ὕδωρ, meaning water,[2] and λαγώς/λαγῶς, meaning hare,[2] and the specific name honors Alexander Collie, who was a ship surgeon and early naturalist. The spotted ratfish is common in much of its range, not typically eaten by humans, and is not commercially caught.[1][3]\n', 'The spotted ratfish has a very distinct appearance compared to unrelated fish species. The female is up to 97\xa0cm (38\xa0in) long, much bigger than the male.

Bonnaterre redescribed the species in 1788 in Orectolobus, its current genus, making its full scientific name Orectolobus maculatus, with Squalus maculatus now a synonym of it.[3][4] Other synonyms of the species include Squalus barbatus (Gmelin, 1789), Squalus lobatus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801), Squalus appendiculatus (Shaw & Nodder, 1806), and Squalus labiatus (Bleeker, 1857). The spotted wobbegong\'s genus name is based on the Greek words ""orektos"" and ""lobos"", and translates roughly to ""stretched out lobe"".[3] Its specific name, maculatus, means ""spotted"" in Latin, named as such for the spotted pattern of its body. Alternate common names in English for the species include carpet shark, common carpet shark, common catshark, tassel shark, and wobbegong.[4]\n'] ['The spotted wobbegong has a large, robust body, which thins beyond its pelvic fins.[7] It grows in the range of 150–180 centimetres (59–71\xa0in), but can reach 320 centimetres (130\xa0in). It is green, yellow, or brown in colour,[4] with a darker back and darker saddles. It is covered with O-shaped spots, which distinguish it from other species that look similar to it. It has six to ten dermal lobes behind and in front of its eye[7] and a tubercle above its eye.[4] Its body lacks ridges or caudal keels.[3] Other characteristics of the species include dermal flaps surrounding the rim of its mouth,[8] large barbels extending from its nostrils,[7] and large spiracles.[3]\n', 'Like other sharks, the spotted wobbegong has abundant pores that operate as electroreceptors in its skin. They are used to detect the electric fields of nearby animals, making it easier to find prey. Marine & Freshwater Research, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, studied and compared the electroreceptors of the spotted wobbegong to those of the Australian angelshark (Squatina australis), a distantly related shark species. The spotted wobbegong has a more complex electrosensory system than the Australian angelshark, and the spotted wobbegong has a pore cluster inside its snout that is not present in the Australian angelshark. For both species, these electroreceptors are an important mechanism in feeding.[9]\n']"
Orectolobus_ornatus,"['The ornate wobbegong (Orectolobus ornatus) is a species of carpet shark that lives in Australia and possibly other countries in the Western Pacific Ocean.

Described by Charles Walter De Vis in 1883, it is similar in appearance to other Australian wobbegongs and has previously been classified as the same species as the Gulf wobbegong. It is a nocturnal species, hunting at night, and it can bite humans when disturbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a least-concern species.\n', 'The ornate wobbegong was described by Charles Walter De Vis in 1883. It was previously assumed to be the juvenile form of the Gulf wobbegong (Orectolobus halei), due to similarities between the two species. However, there are multiple differences: for example, the ornate wobbegong is smaller, has a smaller head relative to its body, and is less freckled.[1]\n'] [""The ornate wobbegong's upperside is golden brown in colour with blueish-grey areas, and it is yellow-green on its underside.

It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.[4] Lemon sharks can grow to 3.4 metres (11\xa0ft) in length. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return to specific nursery sites for breeding. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their main source of prey, fish. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to  live young, and the females are polyandrous and have a biennial reproductive cycle. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to humans; there have been 10 recorded bites, none of which were life-threatening. The lemon shark's life span is unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old.[5] The oldest recorded lemon shark in captivity died in 2023 at the age of 40 years.[6]\n"", 'The lemon shark was first named and described in 1868 by Felipe Poey.[7] He originally named it Hypoprion brevirostris, but later renamed it Negaprion brevirostris.[7] The lemon shark has also appeared in literature as Negaprion fronto and Carcharias fronto (Jordan and Gilbert, 1882), Carcharias brevirostris (Gunther, 1870), and Carcharhinus brevirostris (Henshall, 1891).[7]\n'] [""The shark's yellow colouring serves as an excellent camouflage when swimming over the sandy seafloor in its coastal habitat.[8] The lemon shark commonly attains a length of 2.4 to 3.1\xa0m (7.9 to 10.2\xa0ft) and a weight up to 90\xa0kg (200\xa0lb) by adulthood, although sexual maturity is attained at 2.24\xa0m (7.3\xa0ft) in males and 2.4\xa0m (7.9\xa0ft) in females.[9] The maximum recorded length and weight is 3.43\xa0m (11.3\xa0ft) and 183.7\xa0kg (405\xa0lb), respectively.[3] It has a flattened head with a short, broad snout, and the second dorsal fin is almost as large as the first. Like all cartilaginous fish, lemon sharks have electroreceptors concentrated in their heads, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini.[10] These receptors detect electrical pulses emitted by potential prey and allow these nocturnal feeders to sense their prey in the dark.[10] Note that lemon sharks are often confused with bull sharks; lemon sharks have quite similarly sized first and second dorsal fins, whereas those of bull sharks are differently sized.[11]\n"", 'Lemon sharks are found from New Jersey to southern Brazil in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean. They also live off the coast of west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic.[12] In addition, lemon sharks have been found in the eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador and in Cape Verde in Sal Island.[12] This species of shark often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, enclosed bays, and river mouths; however, lemon sharks have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92\xa0meters (301 feet.)[13] Although lemon sharks do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their lives.[2]\n']"
Isogomphodon_oxyrhynchus,"['The daggernose shark (Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus) is a little-known species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, and the only extant member of its genus.

A relatively small shark typically reaching 1.5\xa0m (4.9\xa0ft) in length, the daggernose shark is unmistakable for its elongated, flattened, and pointed snout, tiny eyes, and large paddle-shaped pectoral fins.\n', 'Daggernose sharks are predators of small schooling fishes. Its reproduction is viviparous, with females give birth to 2–8 pups every other year during the rainy season; this species is capable of shifting the timing of its reproductive cycle by several months in response to the environment. Harmless to humans, the daggernose shark is caught for food and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries. Limited in range and slow-reproducing, it has been assessed as Critically Endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature in light of a steep population decline in recent years. The current population is believed to be extremely low, with no more than 250 individuals believed to be in existence as of 2023.[2] Indeed, it may even be in reproductive collapse, in which case it will likely become extinct in the near future.[3]\n'] ['As its common name suggests, the daggernose shark has a very long, flattened snout with a pointed tip and an acutely triangular profile from above.

This species exhibits the most advanced mode of viviparity of any fish, in which the developed embryos form a highly complex placental connection to the mother at a very small size. Females breed year-round, giving birth to six to 18 pups after a gestation period of 5–6 months. The spadenose shark is harmless to humans and is valued by artisanal and commercial fishers for its meat and fins.

The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) are at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch is near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe.[7] The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.[3]\n']"
Isurus_oxyrinchus,"['The shortfin mako shark (/ˈmɑːkoʊˌ ˈmeɪ-/; Māori: /ˈmaːko/; Isurus oxyrinchus), also known as the shortfin mako, blue pointer, or bonito shark, is a large mackerel shark.

The fastest known shark species, able to reach speeds of 74\xa0km/h (46\xa0mph) in bursts, the shortfin mako can attain a size of 4\xa0m (13\xa0ft) in length and weigh 570\xa0kg (1,260\xa0lb). The species is classified as Endangered by the IUCN.\n', '""Mako"" comes from the Māori language,[3] meaning either the shark or a shark tooth. Following the Māori language, ""mako"" in English is both singular and plural.  The word may have originated in a dialectal variation, as it is similar to the common words for shark in a number of Polynesian languages—makō in the Kāi Tahu Māori dialect,[4] mangō in other Māori dialects,[4] mago in Samoan, ma\'o in Tahitian, and mano in Hawaiian. The first written usage is in Lee and Kendall\'s Grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand (1820), which simply states, ""Máko; A certain fish"".[5][6] Richard Taylor\'s A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand (1848) is more elaborate: ""Mako, the shark which has the tooth so highly prized by the Maoris"".[7]\nIn 1809, Constantine Rafinesque gave the short-fin mako the scientific name Isurus oxyrinchus (isurus means ""the same tail"", oxyrinchus means ""pointy snout"").[citation needed]\n'] ['The shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in comparison to other species in the lamnid family.[8] An average adult specimen measures around 2.5 to 3.2\xa0m (8.2 to 10.5\xa0ft) in length and weighs from 60–140\xa0kg (130–310\xa0lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, with females typically larger than males. Large specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of 3.8\xa0m (12\xa0ft) and a weight of 550\xa0kg (1,210\xa0lb).[8] The largest taken on hook-and-line was 600\xa0kg (1,300\xa0lb), caught off the coast of California on June 3, 2013,[9] and the longest verified length was 4.45\xa0m (14.6\xa0ft) caught off the Mediterranean coast of France in September 1973. A specimen caught off the coast of Italy and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary 1,000\xa0kg (2,200\xa0lb) at a length of 4\xa0m (13\xa0ft).[10] Yet another fish was caught off Marmaris, Turkey in the late 1950s at an estimated size of between 5.7 and 6.19\xa0m (18.7 and 20.3\xa0ft) making it the largest known specimen of the species.[11] However, this estimate was created using photos of the shark and not at the time of capture so this estimate must be taken with reasonable caution. The authors did not estimate a weight for this specimen.[citation needed]\n', 'The shortfin mako shark is cylindrical in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the shortfin mako shark, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the mako from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus Lamna.[citation needed] The shortfin mako shark is also credited as being the fastest shark in the ocean, reaching moving speeds of 50\xa0km/h (31\xa0mph) with bursts up to 74\xa0km/h (46\xa0mph). Due to this, it is often known as the ""cheetah"" or ""peregrine falcon of sharks.""[citation needed]\n']"

Alopias_pelagicus,"['The pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus) is a species of thresher shark, family Alopiidae; this group of sharks is characterized by the greatly elongated upper lobes of their caudal fins. The pelagic thresher occurs in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, usually far from shore, but occasionally entering coastal habitats. It is often confused with the common thresher (A. vulpinus), even in professional publications, but can be distinguished by the dark, rather than white, color over the bases of its pectoral fins. The smallest of the three thresher species, the pelagic thresher typically measures 3\xa0m (10\xa0ft) long.\n', 'The diet of the pelagic thresher consists mainly of small midwater fishes, which are stunned with whip-like strikes of its tail. Along with all other mackerel sharks, the pelagic thresher exhibits ovoviviparity and usually gives birth to litters of two. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on unfertilized eggs produced by the mother. The young are born unusually large, up to 43% the length of the mother. Pelagic threshers are valued by commercial fisheries for their meat, skin, liver oil, and fins, and are also pursued by sport fishers.

This species has a fusiform body (wide in the middle and tapered at the ends) and a very slender upper caudal fin lobe nearly as long as the rest of the shark. The pectoral fins are long and straight with broad, rounded tips. The first dorsal fin is placed halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and is of comparable size to the pelvic fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny.[3]\n', 'The head is narrow with a short, conical snout and a distinctive ""pinched"" profile when viewed from below.

With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common thresher resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins. The common thresher is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, though it prefers cooler temperatures.

Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.\n'] ['The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flat snout, resembling a blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age.[19] The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape.

The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation of tooth length and width occurs, as for whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and regarding the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.[5][7][20]\n', ""The body is fairly slender and flabby.

The asymmetric caudal fin has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe.[7][20] The soft, semi-translucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of dermal denticles, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. Living sharks of this species are pink or tan due to visible blood vessels beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white.

Their sharp snouts are produced by a cranial projection of rostral cartilage. The mouth and gills are located on the underside of the body. They may be either solid-coloured or patterned, and most skates have spiny or thornlike structures on the upper surface, while some species contain weak electrical organs within their tails. Mating typically occurs in the spring and the female lays numerous eggs per clutch which are encapsulated in leathery cases, commonly known as ""mermaid’s purses"". Species vary in size, ranging from about 40\xa0to 140\xa0cm (1.3–4.6\xa0ft) in length.[2] These bottom-dwellers are active during both day and night, and typically feed on molluscs, crustaceans and fish. Raja skates are found in the East Atlantic, also in the Mediterranean, and western Indian Ocean, ranging from relatively shallow water to a depth of 800\xa0m (2,600\xa0ft).[2] Skates and related species have fossil records dating from the Upper Cretaceous period, thus this well-adapted lineage is quite ancient.\n'] []"

Typhlonarke_aysoni,"['Astrape aysoni A. Hamilton, 1902\n', 'The blind electric ray (Typhlonarke aysoni) is a little-known species of sleeper ray in the family Narkidae, endemic to New Zealand. It is found on the bottom, typically at a depth of 300–400\xa0m (980–1,310\xa0ft). Reaching 38\xa0cm (15\xa0in) in length, this species has a thin, nearly circular pectoral fin disc without visible eyes, and a short tail with a single dorsal fin. Its pelvic fins are divided in two, with the anterior portion forming a limb-like appendage; in males the claspers do not extend past the disc margin. A weak swimmer, the blind electric ray likely pushes itself along using its pelvic fins. It is known to feed on polychaete worms, and can defend itself with an electric shock. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not have enough information to assess the conservation status of this species.\n'] ['The blind electric ray has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc measuring about 70% of the total length, with rather thin margins. The tiny eyes are not visible externally, being located 1–2\xa0mm (0.039–0.079\xa0in) beneath the surface of the skin; their positions are indicated by small white patches. Following the eyes are oval spiracles with raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are closely spaced, with their outer margins curled to form near-complete tubes, and their inner margins enlarged and fused together into a fleshy, skirt-shaped curtain that almost reaches the mouth. The mouth is small and deeply recessed. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern to form narrow plates limited to the front of the jaws. There are 10–12 tooth rows in either jaw; the innermost teeth have a sharp cusp, while the outermost teeth are worn down and flattened. The five pairs of gill slits are short and curved.[4]\n', 'The anterior portion of each pelvic fin is modified into a wide, paddle-like appendage. The posterior portion of the pelvic fins merge smoothly with the pectoral fins to form part of the disc; there is a notch where their margins meet the tail. Adult males have relatively small, slightly flattened claspers whose tips do not extend past the disc margin. The single dorsal fin is rectangular in shape with a rounded trailing margin, and originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases. The short, thick tail bears faint lateral skin folds along either side and terminates in a nearly circular caudal fin slightly longer than tall. The skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles. This species is uniformly brown above, becoming darker towards the tail, and beige below. The undersides of the pelvic fin appendages are nearly white.[4] Most blind electric rays do not exceed 38\xa0cm (15\xa0in) in length.[1] However, there is an old report of a specimen that may have been over 1.1\xa0m (3.6\xa0ft) long.[4]\n']"

On the dorsal side of their body they have a brown coloration and a white coloration on their ventral side. They have more of an elongated/protruding body size, they aren't very short or rounded, this helps to differentiate them from other ray species.[2] The jaw arch, which consist of the lower and upper jaw, moves as a unit, this allows for them to create suction in order to feed and capture prey hiding in the sand or mud substrate. The limitation to this is, there are a series of ligaments that constrict the jaws from moving in other directions, because of this it may cause limits in their diet, but at the same time increase their suction ability.[8]\n"", 'They have an electroreceptor system located on the ventral part of their body that is sensitive to low frequency, they use this in order to search for prey. The system is composed of many sensory units, known as Ampullae of Lorenzini, these are connected to the environment and the nervous system through external pores and canals by nerves and fibers.[7] What is special about this species, is they have electric organs that can generate an average voltage about 0.35 mV.[9] The organs are located in their pectoral fins and they are noticeable when you look at the ray from the frontal few. The lobules have hexagonal faces and they show their shape through the skin.[2] The size and number of the cells in the electric organs are higher in adults than in embryos/newborns,[6] this causes the newborns to generate weaker electric organ discharge,[9] which makes them more vulnerable to predators.\n']"

P. productus was first described by ichthyologist William Orville Ayre in 1854 as Rhinobatos productus,[2] with the genus derived from the Greek word rhinos, meaning nose, and the Latin word batis, meaning ray.[3] It was later placed in the genus Pseudobatos following reconsideration of many species placed in Rhinobatos.[4] As its common name suggests, this species possesses a pointed shovel-shaped snout and a body similar to that of a guitar with a larger head and long, slender body. The shovelnose is considered to be a primitively developed ray, with many features of both sharks and rays. The shovelnose guitarfish was first considered to be a shark because of its dorsal fins' shape. Fossils of P. productus ancestors have been recovered, dating back over 100 million years.[5]\n"", ""The coloration of this species ranges from olive to sandy brown which aids in the species' ability to camouflage in the sand.[6] Other identifying features of Pseudobatos productus include a depressed body shape with a dorsoventrally flattened opaque snout, no gap between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and protruding eyes. This species also has two dorsal fins which are closer to the posterior end of its body and caudal fin.[7] Shovelnose guitarfish have around 102 to 112 small round teeth. Sexual maturity is reached in females at an estimated age of 8 years and 7 years in males.[8]\n""] [""The coloration of this species ranges from olive to sandy brown which aids in the species' ability to camouflage in the sand.[6] Other identifying features of Pseudobatos productus include a depressed body shape with a dorsoventrally flattened opaque snout, no gap between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and protruding eyes.

Males are between 90–100\xa0cm (35–39\xa0in) long, while females are around 99\xa0cm (39\xa0in) at that age.[9] The average size of shovelnose guitarfish is still not well known as many studies have seen fluctuations in the total length they can reach. The ray can live up to 11 years, and full-grown sizes are around 120\xa0cm (47\xa0in) for males, and females reach 137\xa0cm (54\xa0in).[9]\nThe shovelnose guitarfish may be mistaken for similar batoids such as the Atlantic guitarfish, Rhinobatos lentiginosus, and bowmouth guitarfish, Rhina ancylostoma. However these species tend to be found in different regions. The Atlantic guitarfish has similar anatomical features to that of a shovelnose but is shorter with a maximum length of about 63.5\xa0cm (about 2.08\xa0ft) and lives in the Atlantic Ocean.[10] The bowmouth guitarfish is found in waters of the Indo-West Pacific and has a more rounded snout than the shovelnose, and larger dorsal fins which can reach lengths up to cm (about 9.68\xa0ft).[11]\n']"

Pteroplatytrygon_violacea,"['The pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, and the sole member of its genus. It is characterized by the wedge-like shape of its pectoral fin disc, which is much wider than long, as well as by the pointed teeth in both sexes, whip-like tail with extremely long tail spine, and uniform violet to blue-green coloration. It generally reaches 59\xa0cm (23\xa0in) in width. The pelagic stingray has a worldwide distribution in waters warmer than 19\xa0°C (66\xa0°F), and migrates seasonally to spend the summer closer to the continental shelf and at higher latitudes. The only stingray that almost exclusively inhabits the open ocean, this species is typically found in surface waters down to a depth of 100\xa0m (330\xa0ft). As a consequence of its midwater habits, its swimming style has evolved to feature more of a flapping motion of the pectoral fins, as opposed to the disc margin undulations used by other, bottom-dwelling stingrays.\n', 'The diet of the pelagic stingray consists of free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It is an active hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and has been known to take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph (""uterine milk""). With a short gestation period of 2–4 months, females may bear two litters of 4–13 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the equator, with the exception of the Mediterranean, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by fishery workers, the pelagic stingray can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks).

Polyodon_spathula,"['The American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), also known as a Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cat, or spoonbill, is a species of ray-finned fish.

This family is most closely related to the sturgeons; together they make up the order Acipenseriformes, which are one of the most primitive living groups of ray-finned fish. Fossil records of other paddlefish species date back 125 million years to the Early Cretaceous, with records of Polyodon extending back 65 million years to the early Paleocene. The American paddlefish is a smooth-skinned freshwater fish with an almost entirely cartilaginous skeleton and a paddle-shaped rostrum (snout), which extends nearly one-third its body length. It has been referred to as a freshwater shark because of its heterocercal tail or caudal fin resembling that of sharks, though it is not closely related.[7] The American paddlefish is a highly derived fish because it has evolved specialised adaptations such as filter feeding. Its rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, its primary food source. The only other species of paddlefish that survived to modern times was the Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius), last sighted in 2003 in the Yangtze River in China and considered to have gone extinct no later than 2010.\n', 'The American paddlefish is native to the Mississippi River basin and once moved freely under the relatively unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. It commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, braided channels, backwaters, and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf Coast drainages. Its peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes, with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 1917.[8][9] American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Poaching has also been a contributing factor to its decline and is liable to continue to be so as long as the demand for caviar remains strong. Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range, as well as from New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They have been reintroduced in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio river systems in western Pennsylvania. However, their current range has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. American paddlefish are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and are protected under state, federal and international laws.\n'] ['American paddlefish are among the largest and longest-lived freshwater fishes in North America.[26] They have a shark-like body, average 1.5\xa0m (4.9\xa0ft) in length, weigh 27\xa0kg (60\xa0lb), and can live in excess of thirty years.[27] For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years.[26] The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies, a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season, a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of the U.S. The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone, cleaned of any remaining soft tissue, and cross-sectioned to expose the annual rings. The dentary rings are counted in much the same way a tree is aged. Dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer, and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males.[28]\n', 'American paddlefish are smooth-skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes are small and directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the initial stages of development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching.[29][30]  The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fish.[25][26] Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.[24]\n']"

They prefer the point of the river where there is an illuminated white bottom and open space for them to swim way above the bottom of the river. The Kaluga also prefers to avoid any cover from the river. Observations suggest that the Kaluga embryos might do this to avoid predators near the bottom of the river. The Kaluga sturgeon are currently endangered now because of human interaction. However, environmental factors such as warm water temperatures pose risk for fungus over free embryos and could be a cause of death also. The migration intensity of Kaluga is also a big factor in the life of a Kaluga. Water velocity in the stream has a great effect on the migration of the free embryos, meaning that the greater the force of the stream of water is the more likely the embryo migrates. Migration plays a big role in Kaluga's early life. The migration of baby Kaluga is considered a passive migration because the embryos have no control over where the river flow takes them. However, when grown the Kaluga constantly migrates back and forth between upstream and downstream. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years, comparable to humans.\n""]"

Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding.[5] The eels are able to travel this long distance without nutrients because of the oils they collect in their bodies before the migration out to sea. The spawning area for this species is approximately 15°N, 140°E, a location corresponding with the location of a salinity front separating the north equatorial current from the tropical waters. This front is an indicator to tell the eels that they are in their preferred spawning location.

They usually breed in April and May.\n'] ['Common snowtrout have streamlined body with smooth and soft skin covered in small scales to assist cutaneous respiration. They have short blunt head with broad and flat interorbital space. The upper jaw is longer than the lower part (inferior mouth) with a strip of hard papillated structure at chin called the adhesive organ; two pairs of barbels which are smaller than eye diameter. The keratinized lips help this species scraping off algae from the substrate as well as providing sturdy grip on the rocks in fast-flowing waters of Himalaya. The pharyngeal teeth are arranged in three rows with the counts of 4,3,2/2,3,4; and the hyobranchial skeleton have the same number of teeth.[3] The dorsal fin originates near the snout tip. The dorsal spine is bony, strong and serrated at the hind part; originate at the anterior part of pelvic fins. The pectoral fins are shorter than head; and pelvic fins do not reach vent. There is tiled row of scales forming a sheath on either side of vent and anal fin, with lateral line complete and is arched.[4]\n', 'Common snowtrout possess a unique adhesive organ by which they cling themselves on the rocky substrate of their habitat. This adhesive organ can be found on the ventral part of the head, just beneath the lower lip. This adhesive organ is made up from keratinized epidermis cells which possess larger number keratinocytes compared to epidermis elsewhere over their body.[5] The outer epidermal cells are packed with bundles of tonofilaments and mucous granules which support adhesion. A callus part in their adhesive organ also likely plays role in adhesion. The callus epidermis forms cavities surrounded by tuberculated borders. The adhesion is the result of frictions between tubercles and surface of the substrates. The keratinization of the outer row cells of adhesive organs might protect the adhesive organ against mechanical damage.[5]\n']"

The quillback is long-lived,[3] with age up to 30 years,[4] 44 years,[5] 49 years,[6] and 52 years[7] documented across different studies throughout North America.\n', 'The quillback is a medium-sized, deep-bodied fish found throughout North America. It has a small head, humped back and deeply forked caudal fin. The compressed body of the quillback makes it look flattened when viewed from the side.[8] The quillback has a subterminal mouth with no barbels, and no nipple-like protrusions on the bottom lip. It has large, reflective, silver cycloid scales that are responsible for giving the quillback its characteristic silver color. They have a white belly with yellow or orange lower fins. The tail and dorsal fin are usually gray or silver. The quillback gets its name from the long quill that is formed via the first several fin rays of the dorsal fin. Quillback are typically 15–20 inches on average, weighing between 1 and 4 pounds. However, they can grow up to 26 inches and weigh 10 pounds. The quillback has a nearly straight, hyper-sensitive lateral line, composed of at least 37 lateral line scales. This helps the fish locate predators and prey.[citation needed]\n'] []"

Ictiobus_cyprinellus,"['The bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) is a fish native to North America that is in decline.[2][3][4][5][6] It is the largest North American species in the Catostomidae or ""sucker"" family, and is one of the longest-lived and latest-maturing freshwater fishes, capable of living 127 years and reproducing infrequently.[4][5][3][6] Even at a century old they show no age-related declines, but instead improvements relative to younger individuals, making this species a biological marvel.[7][8][9] It is commonly called the gourdhead, marblehead, redmouth buffalo, buffalofish, bernard buffalo, roundhead, or brown buffalo.[10] The bigmouth buffalo is not a carp, nor is any other fish in the sucker family. Although they share the same order, each belong to different suborders and are native to separate continents.\n', 'The bigmouth buffalo is typically a brownish olive color with dusky fins, but can vary greatly in color across individuals including melanistic, golden, and even xanthic color morphs.[11][12] Bigmouth buffalo may also accrue unique black or orange pigmentation markings with age,[3][12] and in some rare individuals, white-edged fins.[6] Like other catostomids it has a long dorsal fin, but unlike all other extant species it has a terminal (forward-facing) mouth reflecting its unique, pelagic feeding ecology. It is the largest of the buffalofishes and can reach a length of more than 4\xa0ft (1.2\xa0m) and 80\xa0lb (36\xa0kg) in weight. Generally it lives in lakes, or in sluggish areas of large rivers.

It is a long-lived,[8][9][10][2] stocky fish like its relatives the bigmouth buffalo[11] (I. cyprinellus) and the black buffalo[11][2] (I. niger). The smallmouth buffalo\'s mouth is located ventrally like other Catostomidae species, whereas the bigmouth buffalo\'s mouth is terminal and opens forward. It is thought that smallmouth buffalo eyes are significantly larger than those of the black buffalo. Despite being members of different scientific suborders, these three species are sometimes conflated with common carp (Cyprinus carpio), but an easy and notable difference is that all catostomids lack the characteristic barbels of carp, and carp are not native to North America whereas buffalofish are. Like the other buffalofish species, the smallmouth buffalo is targeted by modern bowfishing. [11][6][4][10][3][2][5][7]\n', 'The coloration of smallmouth buffalo ranges from shades of gray to brown and coppery green dorsally and pale yellow to white ventrally. Fins color match the portion of the body where they attach and are generally darker towards the tips. They are characteristically stocky, having a hump that rises up from the operculum. Pectoral fins protrude ventrally like the anal fins, the caudal fin has even lobes, and the dorsal fin protrudes from the top of the hump to a blunt point, then shortens and runs the remaining length of the body to the base of the tail. Typical adults reach a length around 40–60\xa0cm (16–24\xa0in), with some specimens reaching as much as 30.1\xa0kg (66.4 pounds) and 101.5\xa0cm (40.0\xa0in).[9]\n'] []"

With its sharp pectoral fins, it creates an eddy to disorient its victim, which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole. The skin is very slimy. Skin colour varies with environment. Clear water will give the fish a black color, while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens. The underside is always pale yellow to white in colour. Albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally. With an elongated body-shape, wels are able to swim backwards like eels.\n"", 'The female produces up to 30,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight. The male guards the nest until the brood hatches, which, depending on water temperature, can take from three to ten days.

Most of its growth takes place in its first five years of life.[10] Round-fish can live up to 12 years.[11]\n', 'Round whitefish have regular migrations to and from freshwater tributaries, where spawning takes place.[10][8][11] Spawning sites are layered with various-sized pebbles and are below shoreline currents, roughly 1–1.5 metres (3.5–5\xa0ft) deep. Even at this depth, there is an underwater current, with a velocity of 0.5–1\xa0m/s (1.6–3.3\xa0ft/s), that disperses some of the deposited eggs downstream in the tributary system. Fertilized eggs are 3.1–3.25\xa0mm (0.12–0.13\xa0in) in diameter and are held in spaces between rocks as well as in the ice crystals of the slushy, tributary floor.[10] The sexual dimorphism is subtle in round whitefish in comparison to other species in the salmon family. Males develop defined pearl organs along the side of their bodies and have altered coloration during spawning. Its pelvic, pectoral, and anal fins, as well as its belly, become anywhere from yellow-orange to red in color.[10] Round-fish are fall spawners, laying their eggs between early October and late November, when the water temperature is at or below 2.5\xa0°C (36.5\xa0°F). The spawning migration begins in August, although first maturation fish tend to start migrating as early as June.[10] The round-fish experience their first spawning normally at age seven. These species do not spawn annually, but it is common for first year spawners to spawn the following year. After sexually mature round-fish reach the tributary system, overall growth slows down and annual growth increments decrease from 55–65\xa0mm (2.2–2.6\xa0in) to 40–45\xa0mm (1.6–1.8\xa0in) due to a decrease in food intake.[10]\n']"

Despite this designation, nelma, similarly known as the sheefish or inconnu, is currently often considered to be a distinct species Stenodus nelma, which makes the legitimacy of this use case and its inclusion of both species as one debatable.[1][3][5][4][6]\n'] ['The inconnu has a large, terminal mouth with a protruding lower jaw, a high and pointed dorsal fin, a forked and homocercal tail, and possesses an adipose fin.

Additionally, Stenodus leucichthys, and the closely related nelma, are distinct among whitefish due to their more predatory morphologies.[7] In addition to being extremely closely related species, S. leucichthys and S. nelma are also largely indistinguishable in appearance, however, the two species should not be confused given their ranges occupy different continents.\n', 'Stenodus leucichthys is an anadromous fish, meaning it migrates up stream into fresh waters from the sea in order to spawn and reproduce externally. Egg development can last up to 200 days, culminating in the release of over 100 thousand eggs, with each individual spawning twice during their life cycle (every 2 to 3 years). Migrations can last up to or exceeding a year long, this is partially owing to the slow development of their gonads which can require up to 8 months spent in the river to fully mature, just in time for their spawning season.[2][10] In terms of development, inconnu larvae reach the fingerling stage at approximately 30 to 40 days and have a maturation period lasting 3 to 6 years, with males typically reaching maturity about one year earlier.[2] Although historically calculated based on their scales, age is most accurately measured by analyzing the otolith or fin rays, particularly pectoral fin rays, of Stenodus as crowding of scales in old age fish reduces the accuracy and readability of these measurements. However, the accuracy of these measurements has only been analyzed in the North American populations of the closely related, or possible subspecies, Stenodus nelma.[11]\n']"

Brook trout can reach at least seven years of age, with reports of 15-year-old specimens observed in California habitats to which the species has been introduced. Growth rates are dependent on season, age, water and ambient air temperatures, and flow rates.

Their average length is about 40–55\xa0cm (16–22\xa0in), with maximum recorded lengths of up to 150\xa0cm (59\xa0in) and maximum weights of 28.4\xa0kg (63\xa0lb).[3] The IGFA currently recognises a 25\xa0kg (55\xa0lb) pike caught by Lothar Louis on Greffern Lake, Germany, on 16 October 1986, as the all-tackle world-record holding northern pike. [4] Northern pike grow to larger sizes in Eurasia than in North America, and in coastal Eurasian regions than inland ones.[5]\n'] ['Northern pike are most often olive green, shading from yellow to white along the belly. The flank is marked with short, light bar-like spots and a few to many dark spots on the fins. Sometimes, the fins are reddish. Younger pike have yellow stripes along a green body; later, the stripes divide into light spots and the body turns from green to olive green. The lower half of the gill cover lacks scales, and it has large sensory pores on its head and on the underside of its lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.\n', 'A hybrid between northern pike and muskellunge is known as a tiger muskellunge (Esox masquinongy × lucius or Esox lucius × masquinongy,[7] depending on the sex of each of the contributing species). In the hybrids, the males are invariably sterile, while females are often fertile, and may back-cross with the parent species.[8] Another form of northern pike, the silver pike, is not a subspecies but rather a mutation that occurs in scattered populations. Silver pike, sometimes called silver muskellunge, lack the rows of spots and appear silver, white, or silvery-blue in color.[9] When ill, silver pike have been known to display a somewhat purplish hue; long illness is also the most common cause of male sterility.\n']"
Esox_masquinongy,"['\n', 'The muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), often shortened to muskie, musky, ski, or lunge, is a species of large freshwater predatory fish native to North America.

Like the northern pike and other aggressive pikes, the body plan is typical of ambush predators with an elongated body, flat head, and dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins set far back on the body. Muskellunge are typically 70–120\xa0cm (28–48 inches) long and weigh 7–16.5\xa0kg (15–36\xa0lb),[6] though some have reached up to 1.8\xa0m (6\xa0ft) and almost 30\xa0kg (70\xa0lb).[7] Martin Arthur Williamson caught a muskellunge with a weight of 27.8\xa0kg (61.25 pounds) in November 2000 on Georgian Bay.[8] The fish are a light silver, brown, or green, with dark vertical stripes on the flank, which may tend to break up into spots. In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from turbid waters. This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings. A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the sensory pores on the underside of the mandible. A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six. The lobes of the caudal (tail) fin in muskellunge come to a sharper point, while those of northern pike are more generally rounded. In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their opercula.[citation needed]\n', 'Anglers seek large muskies as trophies or for sport.[9]  In places where muskie are not native, such as in Maine, anglers are encouraged not to release the fish back into the water because of their negative impact on native populations of trout and other smaller fish species.[10]\n']"

Its diet consists of various demersal fish and small invertebrates.[1] They include: shrimp, crabs, and cephalopods.[2] Because the inshore lizardfish reside in environments that have lots of changing conditions, the inshore lizardfish diet also changes with the conditions. In the Gulf of Mexico, specifically, the inshore lizardfish relies on certain species to get through the seasons. During the colder months, between November and February, inshore lizardfish mainly rely on two different species: U. parvus and L. pealei. During the rainier season, the inshore lizardfish was seen to rely on E. senta and L. pealei.[8] The inshore lizardfish is seen hunting in a wild manner where it lurches at its prey and then quickly finishes it off. There are records of inshore lizardfish that have shrimp, crabs, squid, sea urchins, and annelids in their stomachs, but other smaller fish are their main food source.  Its diverse diet allows it to adapt to many different biotic and abiotic conditions and it has a large niche because of its flexibility.[9] In a study conducted in Florida about the parasites within synodus foetens, the digestive tracts and stomachs were observed in many specimens. In the article, ""Parasites of the Inshore Lizardfish, Synodus Foetens, from South Florida, Including a Description of a New Genus of Cestoda"", they found many species like, ""Penaeus duorarum, a palaemonid shrimp, several\nspecies of small crustaceans, and the fishes Synodus foe tens, Anchoa mitchilli, Lagodon rhomboides, Eucinostomus argenteus, Sphaeroides sp.,Cyprinodon variegatus, Poeciiia iatipinna, Gobionel/us sp., a cyprinodontid, an atherinid, and others that were too digested to identify"" (Overstreet, 1968).[9]\n']"

The species is closely related to marine fish such as the common ling and cusk, all of which belong to the family Lotidae (rocklings).\n', 'The name burbot comes from the Latin word barba, meaning beard, referring to its single chin whisker, or barbel.[7] Its generic and specific names, Lota lota, comes from the old French[8] lotte fish, which is also named ""barbot"" in Old French.\n'] ['With an appearance like a cross between a catfish and an eel, the burbot has a serpent-like body, but is easily distinguished by a single barbel on the chin.[7] The body is elongated and laterally compressed, with a flattened head and single, tube-like projection for each nostril. The mouth is wide, with both upper and lower jaws having many small teeth. Burbot have two soft dorsal fins, with the first being low and short, and the second being much longer. The anal fin is low and almost as long as the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is rounded, the pectoral fins are fan-shaped, and pelvic fins are narrow with an elongated second fin ray. Having such small fins relative to body size indicates a benthic lifestyle with low swimming endurance, unable to withstand strong currents.\n', 'Burbot have circumpolar distribution above 40°\xa0N. Populations are continuous from France across Europe and chiefly Russian Asia to the Bering Strait. In North America, burbot range from the Seward Peninsula in Alaska to New Brunswick along the Atlantic Coast. Burbot are most common in streams and lakes of North America and Europe. They are fairly common in Lake Erie, but are also found in the other Great Lakes.[9] An anadromous population also lives in the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea.[10] Recent genetic analysis suggests the geographic pattern of burbot may indicate multiple species or subspecies, making this single taxon somewhat misleading.[11]\n']"

Hippocampus_erectus,"['The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), northern seahorse or spotted seahorse, is a species of fish that belongs to the family Syngnathidae.[3][4] H. erectus is a diurnal species with an approximate length of 15\xa0cm (5.9 inches) and lifespan of one to four years. The H. erectus species can be found in myriad colors, from greys and blacks to reds, greens, and oranges. The lined seahorse lives in the western Atlantic Ocean as far north as Canada and as far south as the Caribbean, Mexico, and Venezuela. It swims in an erect position and uses its dorsal and pectoral fins for guidance while swimming.\n', ""Lined seahorses feed mainly on minute crustaceans and brine shrimp, which they suck in through their snout. They are able to suck their prey by creating a current of water leading directly into its snout. Since seahorses are weak swimmers, they must ambush their prey by blending into their surroundings, which they do rather easily. The lined seahorse's eyes can move independently of one another, allowing it to effectively scan its surroundings. The species is sexually dimorphic and it is easy to distinguish between a male and female lined seahorse. The males are larger and also have longer tails. The lined seahorse is monogamous and performs ritual dances every morning to reestablish the bond with its mate. In addition, they create clicking sounds while embracing their partner. This action occurs when they initially find their mate. The intensity of their bond is also conveyed in how they handle the death of their partner: If either the male or female should die, the mate does not automatically replace the deceased mate with a new one. Often, it fails to find a new mate in its short lifespan.\n""] [' The lined seahorse was first named Hippocampus Erectus by George Perry in 1810.[5] ""Hippocampus"" translates into ""horse or sea monster"" in ancient Greek.[6] The lined seahorse is a diurnal species that ranges in length from 12\xa0cm to 17\xa0cm; the maximum length reported for the species is 19\xa0cm. The seahorse is sexually dimorphic, meaning there are distinct differences in appearances of males and females; most notably the brood pouch located on the male\'s abdomen which it utilized in reproduction. Males are also slightly larger in size and have longer prehensile tails than the females. In the wild, the lined seahorse has a lifespan of one to four years; however, in captivity their lifespan usually reaches the full four years. Four years is the maximum age reported for the species.[7] They have a broad color spectrum, ranging from black, grey, brown, and green, to orange, red, and yellow. They tend to be paler on their front side.[6] However, their colors change due to altercations in their environment, diet, anxiety or stress level, and/or mood.[8] The lined seahorse is brawny and upright in appearance. They have an armor-like body composed of approximately fifty bony plates. Together these bony plates form the outer skeleton of the species. It is common for the species to have white lines outlining the neck area—hence its common name, ""lined seahorse""—and for tiny white dots to be present on the tail. The prehensile tail consists of numerous rings and the first, third, fifth, seventh, and eleventh may protrude farther outward than the remaining. The prehensile tail following the bony plates is utilized by the seahorse to grasp onto its environment composed of seaweed and coral. The tail curls forward and is seldom aligned. When a lined seahorse is very young (two weeks to four weeks), the tail is extremely limber. The snout length is approximately half the head length of the lined seahorse. The cheek spines, located diagonally down from the eye on either side may be single or double. In total, the lined seahorse has eleven trunk rings, 34–39 tail rings, 16–20 dorsal fin rays, and 14–18 pectoral fin rays. The pectoral fin is level with the eye on each back side of the lined seahorse\'s head. The dorsal fin is located on the back of the skeleton and is level with the stomach–chest area. Female dorsal fins are slightly larger than the male\'s and are located lower on the back. The eyes of the lined seahorse can concentrate together, or they can operate independently of one another.[9] The lined seahorse may be considered sexually mature as early as four months; however, it is typically about eight months. The minimum size of a sexually mature lined seahorse is 5.6\xa0cm.[8][10]\n', 'The lined seahorse range spans from the northern point of Nova Scotia, Canada, to the southern area of Venezuela in South America. They can be found on the east coast of America in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, and the Carolinas,  as well as in the waters surrounding Mexico and the Caribbean. Species found in Brazil seem to be of a different species; however, more research is needed to determine this proposal. The lined seahorse is native to the following locations: Nova Scotia, Canada, United States, Bermuda, Cuba, Mexico (Veracruz, Yucatán), Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Venezuela. It has also been recorded from the Azores but it is not clear that a population has become established in the waters around that archipelago.[1]\n']"

The teeth of the fish are a major diagnostic feature of the species, with the upper jaw having two irregular rows of small conical teeth at the front of the mouth, transitioning to a paving of blunt teeth at the back.[9] The lower jaw is similar, having two rows of short conical teeth in the front of the jaw changing to one row of blunter teeth further back. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first containing eight weak spines while the second consists of a single spine followed by 23 to 26 soft rays. The anal fin has two detached spines anterior to the main section, which consists of a single spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays.[10] The upper caudal fin lobe is larger than the lower lobe, whilst the pelvic fin is quite small in comparison to those of other carangids. The lateral line is strongly arched anteriorally, with the arched and straight sections of the line intersecting below the fourth to sixth soft dorsal rays. The curved section of the line contains  32 to 46 scales and up to 2 scutes, while the straight section consists of 35 to 45 scutes and up to 2 scales.

Caranx_lugubris,"[""Caranx lugubris, the black jack,  black trevally, black kingfish, coal fish or black ulua, is a species of large ocean fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species has a circumtropical distribution, found in oceanic, offshore waters of the tropical zones of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The species is particularly prevalent around offshore islands such as the Caribbean islands in the Atlantic, Hawaii and French Polynesia in the Pacific and the Seychelles and Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Black jack are rare in shallow waters, preferring deep reefs, ledges and seamounts in clear waters. The species is easily distinguished by its black to grey fins and jet black scutes, with the head having a steep profile near the snout. The largest recorded length is 1 m and weight of 17.9\xa0kg. The black jack lives either individually or in small schools, and is known to school with other species. It is a predatory fish, taking a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs as prey. Sexual maturity is reached at 34.6\xa0cm in females and 38.2\xa0cm in males, with spawning taking place between February and September in the Caribbean. The early life history of the species is very poorly understood. Black jack are of high importance to many island fisheries, but are rarely encountered in most continental fisheries. The species has a reputation as a gamefish, and is variably considered a terrible or excellent food fish, although several cases of ciguatera poisoning have been attributed to the species. The species was initially named Caranx ascensionis by Georges Cuvier, however several issues with the use of this name have seen Felipe Poey's name Caranx lugubris become the valid scientific name.\n"", 'The black jack is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes.[2]\n'] [""The black jack is a large fish, and is confidently known to grow to a length of 1 m[8] and a weight of 17.9 kg,[21] although is more common at lengths under 70\xa0cm.[15] At least one source asserts a fish of 2.21 m has been reported,[22] which if true would make the black jack the second largest species of carangid behind the yellowtail amberjack (2.5 m).[8] The black jack has a similar overall body shape to the other members of Caranx, having an oblong, compressed form, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile.[23] This convexity is most pronounced at the head, which slopes steeply downwards, giving the head profile a very angular appearance. The profile between the snout and the nape is concave, with this indent centered near the nostrils.[24] The mouth is fairly large compared to other members of its genus and the maxilla extends to under the centre of the fish's eye.[25] The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of widely spaced conical teeth.[23] The dorsal fin of the black jack is in two sections; the first has 8 spines and the second 1 spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 anteriorly detached spines and 16 to 19 soft rays. The lobes of both the dorsal and anal fins are elongated.[15] The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 21 soft rays, while the pectoral fins are falcate and longer than the head.[24] The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains around 50 scales[24] while the straight section 26 to 32 strong scutes. The caudal peduncle also has paired bilateral keels. The chest is completely covered in scales, which like the rest of the body are small and cycloid in nature. The species has 23 to 30 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present.[23]\n"", ""The body of the black jack is a uniform olive to brown, grey and even black colour along the back that lightens to a grey-blue near the underside of the fish.

Caranx_melampygus,"['The bluefin trevally (Caranx melampygus), also known as the bluefin jack, bluefin kingfish, bluefinned crevalle, blue ulua, omilu, and spotted trevally, is a species of large, widely distributed marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The bluefin trevally is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from Eastern Africa in the west to Central America in the east, including Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species grows to a maximum known length of 117 centimetres (46\xa0in) and a weight of 43.5 kilograms (96\xa0lb), however is rare above 80 centimetres (31\xa0in). Bluefin trevally are easily recognised by their electric blue fins, tapered snout and numerous blue and black spots on their sides. Juveniles lack these obvious colours, and must be identified by more detailed anatomical features such as fin ray and scute counts. The bluefin trevally inhabits both inshore environments such as bays, lagoons and shallow reefs, as well as deeper offshore reefs, atolls and bomboras. Juveniles prefer shallower, protected waters, even entering estuaries for short periods in some locations.\n', 'The bluefin trevally is a strong predatory fish, with a diet dominated by fish and supplemented by cephalopods and crustaceans as an adult. Juveniles consume a higher amount of small crustaceans, but transfer to a more fish based diet as they grow. The species displays a wide array of hunting techniques ranging from aggressive midwater attacks, reef ambushes and foraging interactions with other larger species, snapping up any prey items missed by the larger animal. The bluefin trevally reproduces at different periods throughout its range, and reaches sexual maturity at 30–40\xa0cm in length and around 2 years of age. It is a multiple spawner, capable of reproducing up to 8 times per year, releasing up to 6 million eggs per year in captivity. Growth is well studied, with the fish reaching 194\xa0mm in its first year, 340\xa0mm in the second and 456\xa0mm in the third year. The bluefin trevally is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishermen. Commercial fisheries record up to 50 tonnes of the species taken per year in the west Indian Ocean, and around 700 lbs per year in Hawaii. The rapid decimation of the Hawaiian population due to overfishing has led to increased research in the aquaculture potential of the species, with spawning achieved in captivity. Despite its popularity as a table fish, many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species.\n'] ['The bluefin trevally is a large fish, growing to a maximum known length of 117\xa0cm and a weight of 43.5\xa0kg,[2] however it is rare at lengths greater than 80\xa0cm.[8] It is similar in shape to a number of other large jacks and trevallies, having an oblong, compressed body with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly.

After they reach lengths greater than 16\xa0cm, blue-black spots appear on the upper flanks of the fish, with these becoming more prolific with age.[10] There is no dark spot on the operculum. The species takes its name from the colour of its dorsal, anal and caudal fins, which are a diagnostic electric blue. The pelvic and pectoral fins are white, with the pectoral fin having a yellow tinge. Juvenile fish do not have the bright blue fins, instead have dark fins with the exception of a yellow pectoral fin.[9] Some juvenile fish have also been recorded as having up to five dark vertical bars on their sides.[7]\n']"

The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The golden trevally is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, rubbery lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 centimetres (47\xa0in) in length and 15 kilograms (33\xa0lb) in weight. The golden trevally schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range.

Elagatis_bipinnulata,"['The rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata), also known as the rainbow yellowtail, Spanish jack and Hawaiian salmon, is a common species of pelagic marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the world, inhabiting both coastal and offshore areas. The species is the only member of the genus Elagatis, which was created 15 years after its initial description, and is closely related to the amberjacks. The rainbow runner is easily distinguished by its body shape, and the brilliant colouration which gives the fish its name. It is a fast-swimming predator, taking small fish, cephalopods, and a wide variety of planktonic crustaceans. The species reaches sexual maturity around 60\xa0cm (24\xa0in), and spawning takes place at different times, with some populations spawning year round, while others only spawn at certain times of the year. The species is a well known game fish, taken by a variety of fishing methods, and is a well-regarded table fish. Large numbers of the species are taken as bycatch in tuna- and shark-fishing operations and marketed.\n', 'The rainbow runner is the only species in the monotypic genus Elagatis, which is one of 30 genera in the jack family, the Carangidae. The Carangidae are perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei.[3] The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species Seriola bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the amberjacks.[4] This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before the species was found to warrant a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera.[5] In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir,[6] which he used in combination with the specific name bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect, as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated.[7] Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the amberjack genus, Seriola, being the most basal member identified of the carangid tribe Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies.[8]\n'] [""The rainbow runner's body is atypical of the jack family, which generally have deep, compressed bodies.[9] The rainbow runner has a subcylindrical, elongated to almost fusiform body, with a long, pointed head and snout and a tapering rear end before the caudal fin emerges. The eyes are relatively small and the teeth are arranged on jaws in villiform bands, with minute teeth also present on the roof of the mouth and tongue.[10] The fish has two dorsal fins, although the posterior rays of the long second fin have separated into a finlet. The first dorsal consists of six spines, the second of a single spine and 25 to 30 soft rays, with the last two as a separate finlet. About 4% of rainbow runners have only five spines in the first dorsal fin, and are apparently born without them.[11] \nThe anal fin consists of one spine detached from the fin anteriorally, while the main fin has a single spine and 18 to 22 soft rays, with the last two detached to form a finlet like the dorsal fin.[12] The dorsal and anal fins are quite low, and the dorsal fin is much longer than the anal. The pectoral fin is small for a carangid, about the length of the pelvic fin and is not falcate, with 20 rays. The pelvic fin consists of one spine and five branched soft rays. The caudal fin is also highly diagnostic, being deeply forked and consisting of 17 caudal rays, 9 dorsally and 8 ventrally.[11] The lateral line has a slight anterior arch and no scutes are present on the line,[9] but possesses about 100 scales. The scales covering the body and parts of the operculum, cheek, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fins are ctenoid in shape. The species has 24 vertebrae.[12]\n"", ""The colour of the fish is possibly the easiest way to identify the rainbow runner, with the name taken from the species' striking colours. The upper body is a dark olive blue to green and fades to white underneath. Two narrow, light blue to bluish white stripes run longitudinally along the sides, with a broader olive to yellow stripe between them.[13] The maximum length of the species is somewhat contentious, with most sources giving a known maximum length between 107 and 120\xa0cm (42 and 47\xa0in) cm,[9][10][12] while one source asserts the species reaches 180\xa0cm (71\xa0in) in length.[14] The maximum known weight is confidently known to be 46.2\xa0kg, as recorded by the International Game Fish Association.[2]\n""]"

Both sexes usually have dappled light brown colouration and white undersides outside of the breeding season, but the sides of females and younger males may have a longitudinal black stripe.[6] This stripe is much fainter in South Island populations, and colouration tends to be darker in fish from more southern locations.[7] When males are reproductively active, their bodies turn completely black and the anal fins gain a pale blue streak.[9] The common triplefin is one of the smaller triplefins in family Tripterygiidae, reaching a maximum of 70\xa0mm in length. Its maximum lifespan has been recorded at up to three years, shorter than most other triplefins, with individuals reaching mature sizes within a year of hatching.[7][10]\n', ""The common triplefin is found across most of New Zealand's mainland coastline, but can also much less frequently be found on offshore islands and has been introduced in Australia.[6] It is most abundant in subtidal depths up to 5 m, and unlike most other New Zealand triplefins who prefer higher amounts of cover, it occupies a wide range of levels of shelter.[6][11] The fish can occasionally occupy intertidal rock pools during low tides, but this is thought to be temporary and has not been associated with reproductive activity like its usual habitat.[7] Habitats are most densely occupied by adult fish just prior to the breeding season, and populations gradually become more sparse as adults spread out again after its end. Adults occupy similar habitats to juveniles in terms of depth and substrate.[4] However, the pattern of distribution density across different maturity levels changes with the number of adults in the habitat; while the amount of juveniles will initially increase alongside the amount of adults in a location, this relationship eventually flips and the number of juveniles will decrease with any additional adults. The decrease in juveniles is partly due to cannibalism of smaller juveniles as adult density increases, and potentially competition with adults or less effective camouflage causing increased predation. The initial positive relationship between juvenile and adult density could be the result of settling juveniles using the number of adults as an indicator of habitat quality.[12]\n""]"

Fundulus_heteroclitus,"['The mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) is a small killifish found along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. Also known as Atlantic killifish, mummies, gudgeons, and mud minnows, these fish inhabit brackish and coastal waters including estuaries and salt marshes. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate highly variable salinity, temperature fluctuations from 6 to 35\xa0°C (43 to 95\xa0°F), very low oxygen levels (down to 1\xa0mg/L), and heavily polluted ecosystems. As a result, the mummichog is a popular research subject in embryological, physiological, and toxicological studies. It is also the first fish ever sent to space, aboard Skylab in 1973.\n', ""The genus name Fundulus comes from fundus, meaning bottom, from the fish's habit of swimming near muddy bottoms. The species name heteroclitus means irregular or unusual. The type specimen was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, from near Charleston, South Carolina. Other scientific names now considered synonyms for this species include Cobitis heteroclita, Fundulus fasciatus, Fundulus pisculentus, and Fundulus nigrofasciatus.[5] The mummichog belongs to the order Cyprinodontiformes, and the family Fundulidae. There are two subspecies: F. h. heteroclitus (Linnaeus, 1766), in the south and F. h. macrolepidotus (Walbaum, 1792) in the north. As F. mudfish this species was designated the type species of Fundulus when Lacépède created the genus in 1803.[6]\n""] ['The body of the mummichog is elongate but thick, with a deep caudal peduncle. Usual length is 7.5 to 9\xa0cm (3.0 to 3.5\xa0in) but a maximum length of up to 15\xa0cm (5.9\xa0in) is possible. The mouth is upturned and the lower jaw protrudes when the mouth is closed. Pectoral and tail fins are round. Mummichogs have 10–13 dorsal fin rays, 9–12 anal fin rays and 16–20 pectoral fin rays. Males have larger dorsal and anal fins than females. There is no lateral line on the body, but lateral line pores are present on the head. The colour is variable (and may even change in shade within the same individual when placed near different backgrounds)[9][10] but is generally olive-brown or olive-green. There can be vertical bars on the sides that are thin, wavy, and silvery. Colors are more intense in males during the reproductive season, as they become dark olive-green on the back, steel-blue on the sides with about 15 silvery bars, and yellow or orange-yellow on the underside; the dorsal fin is mottled and a small eyespot may be present near the rear edge. Females tend to be paler, without bars or the intense yellow on the belly, and their dorsal fin is uniformly coloured.[citation needed]\n', 'Adults of the two subspecies can be distinguished based on slight morphological[11] and genomic[12] differences. Further, eggs of the northern subspecies have filaments (adhesive chorionic fibrils) that eggs of the southern subspecies lack.

Fundulus_luciae,"['Hydrargyra luciae (Baird 1855)\n', 'Fundulus luciae, the spotfin killifish, is a member of the genus Fundulus. This hardy fish is notable for spending its entire life in sporadically flooded salt marsh habitat, sheltering in shallow pools, puddles, and small tidal rivulets.[2] It closely resembles the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) in shape and coloration, but the two species can be distinguished  by dorsal fin ray count: 8–9 in the spotfin versus 11–12 in the mummichog.[3] Additionally, the dorsal fin of F. luciae originates farther back, and slightly behind the anal fin origin; in the mummichog, the dorsal fin begins anteriorly to the anal fin origin.[4] The spotfin killifish is named for the pronounced ocellus found on the posterior dorsal fin of adult males. It is a small fish, seldom attaining 50 millimetres (2.0\xa0in) in total length.[5] Its distribution extends along the U.S. east coast from Massachusetts[6] to Georgia.[7]\n'] [""The spotfin killifish is the smallest member of its genus,[14] rarely exceeding 50 millimetres (2.0\xa0in) total length[5] or 40 millimetres (1.6\xa0in) standard length.[2] Larval fish transition to juvenile stage at around 10\xa0mm standard length.[15] Sexual maturity is attained at approximately 24–27\xa0mm TL (males) and 28–30\xa0mm TL (females).[2] Body shape is elongated and less stocky than Fundulus heteroclitus, with an upturned mouth, flattened head and rounded caudal fin characteristic of the genus. Adults are sexually dimorphic, although both sexes are darker on top with a lighter belly.[3] Juveniles and adult females are similar in appearance, with a body that is grayish-green to olive green in color, lacking a dorsal ocellus, and generally without vertical bars,[2][16] although females may sometimes have sidebars (usually faint).[17] Mature adult females may also have a visible sheath of tissue along the front of the anal fin, which is believed to function as an oviduct.[16] Adult males have 10–14 dark vertical bars and the eponymous dorsal ocellus.[2][3][16] During spawning season males develop dramatic coloration, consisting of vivid yellow-orange pigment extending over the belly, pelvic and anal fins, caudal peduncle, and caudal fin.[2] Breeding males may also develop contact organs–small fleshy protuberances–on the head, sides of the body, and medial fins.[2] Dorsal fin rays number 8–9 (usually 8) which is different from the mummichog, which has 11–12 dorsal fin rays.[3] The anal fin has 10 rays. The spotfin killifish's dorsal fin originates posteriorly to the anal fin origin; this is another useful character that differs from other fundulids, including F. heteroclitus.[18] While adults are distinct, larval fundulids can be tricky to ID to species. Longitudinal scale rows number 34–36.[3] The gill opening is restricted superiorly.[3]\n"", ""The spotfin killifish inhabits the irregularly flooded zone of salt marshes, characterized largely by Spartina spp.(cordgrass) and Juncus roemarianus (needlerush), where it lives in puddles, shallow pools, small tidal rivulets, culms at the base of plants, and even crab burrows.[2][3][15] It is a nonmigratory, permanent resident of the emergent marsh and stays even during low tides.[2][15] Spotfin killifish prefer muddy substrate,[2] probably because mud retains water at low tide more effectively than sand. This species is euryhaline but prefers medium to high salinities.[19] In the wild, it has been captured from salinities ranging from 0–46 ppt.[20] Due to difficulty in sampling the dense mud and thick plants characterizing F. luciae's preferred habitat, the species was once thought to be rare;[17][18] however, more recent studies have shown that it can be locally abundant.[21][22][20][2]\n""]"

The age of the species is unknown, with differing analyses offering ranges between one thousand and sixty thousand years. It is a small fish, with maximum lengths of up to 30\xa0mm (1.2\xa0in). Individuals vary in coloration based on age and sex: males are bright metallic blue while females and juveniles are more yellow. A defining trait of this species is its lack of pelvic fins. The pupfish consumes nearly every available food resource at Devils Hole, including beetles, snails, algae, and freshwater crustaceans, with diet varying throughout the year. It is preyed on by the predaceous diving beetle species Neoclypeodytes cinctellus, which was first observed in Devils Hole in 1999 or 2000. Reproduction occurs year-round, with spikes in the spring and fall. Females produce few eggs and the survivorship from egg to adult is low. Individuals live 10–14 months.\n', 'Devils Hole is more than 130\xa0m (430\xa0ft) deep, though pupfish are only found in the upper 24\xa0m (80\xa0ft). The water is a constant temperature of 33\xa0°C (91\xa0°F) and dissolved oxygen levels are low. A small, shallowly submerged rock shelf provides critical feeding and spawning habitat for the pupfish.[4] Nearby agricultural irrigation in the 1960s and 1970s caused the water to drop in Devils Hole, resulting in less and less of the shelf remaining submerged. Several court cases ensued, resulting in the Supreme Court case Cappaert v. United States, which determined that the preservation of Devils Hole as a National Monument in 1952 implicitly included preservation of adequate groundwater to maintain the scientific value of the pool and its fauna. Other threats faced by the species include flash floods, earthquakes, and vandalism.\n'] [""The Devils Hole pupfish is the smallest pupfish species in the genus Cyprinodon,[18] with lengths up to 30\xa0mm (1.2\xa0in).[18]  The average length is 23\xa0mm (0.9\xa0in).[19] Males and females differ in coloration. Males are overall dark brown with metallic blue on their sides. The margins of all fins are black, and the back has golden iridescence. Iridescence is particularly pronounced on the opercles (gill covers) which have a violet sheen on their posterior side. The iris is blue and also iridescent. Females and young are more yellow in color than the males. Females have yellowish-brown backs, and the margins of their pectoral and caudal fins are yellow, not black. The dorsal fin has a black margin like the males, however. Females' opercles are metallic green, and their eyes are tinted metallic blue. The young are overall colored as the females, though they have a faint vertical bar on their sides.[20]\n"", 'Individuals lack pelvic fins, though have been observed to grow them when raised in lower temperatures in captivity.[21] Its dorsal fin has twelve rays, while each pectoral fin has seventeen rays. The caudal fin is convex in appearance and has twenty-eight rays, curving outward at the margin. Its lateral series (the number of scales from the back end of the opercle to the beginning of the tail[22]) is twenty-seven scales.[20] The scales are ctenoid, or toothed, on the outer margin.[20]\n']"

Cyprinodon_macularius,"['The desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius) is a rare species of bony fish in the family Cyprinodontidae. It is a small fish, typically less than 7.62\xa0cm (3\xa0in) in length. Males are generally larger than females, and have bright-blue coloration, while females and juveniles are silvery or tan. A notable attribute of the desert pupfish is their ability to survive in environments of extreme salinity, pH, and temperature, and low oxygen content. The desert pupfish mates in a characteristic fashion, wherein compatible males and females will come in contact and collectively jerk in an s-shape. Each jerk typically produces a single egg that is fertilized by the male and deposited in his territory. Breeding behavior includes aggressive arena-breeding and more docile consort-pair breeding.\n', 'The desert pupfish is a federally listed endangered species in the United States. The desert pupfish was once a common fish, but it is now extirpated from most of its historical natural range. The decrease in population has been a trend since the early 1900s due to habitat destruction and fragmentation. It has been, and continues to be, preyed upon and displaced by non-native fishes, such as tilapia. Currently, the desert pupfish occurs only in three drainage basins: the Salton Sea, California, the Colorado River Delta, Baja California, and in Sonora, Mexico.[5][6] Historically, the desert pupfish occurred in the drainage basins of the Gila, Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Salt, and lower Colorado River. The range stretched from Arizona to the Gulf of California and Sonora.[5]\n'] ['The desert pupfish is a small fish that is typically less than 7.62\xa0cm (3\xa0in) long; males are larger than females and generally have more vivid markings, especially during breeding seasons. Females and juveniles typically have tan or olive backs and silvery sides with narrow, dark vertical bars situated laterally. These bars are often interrupted to give the impression of a disjunct, lateral band. During mating season, males become bright blue on the dorsal portion of the head and sides, and yellow or orange on the caudal fin and posterior caudal peduncle.[14] The dorsal profile of the desert pupfish is smoothly rounded, while its body is thickened and laterally compressed. The desert pupfish has a protruding mouth equipped with tricuspid teeth.[9]\n', 'The desert pupfish is found in shallow waters of desert springs, small streams, and marshes below 1,524\xa0m (5,000\xa0ft) in elevation.[8] The species can tolerate high salinities, water temperatures, and lower oxygen content than most fish, and will occupy habitats inhospitable to invasive fish.

The female can be distinguished from the male by her larger size and a gravid spot at the posterior of her abdomen. The name ""mosquitofish"" was given because the fish eats mosquito larvae, and has been used more than any other fishes for the biological control of mosquitoes.[3] Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles, mayflies, caddisflies, mites, and other invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up only a small portion of their diet.[4]\n'] ['Mosquitofish are small and of a dull grey coloring, with a large abdomen, and have rounded dorsal and caudal fins and an upturned mouth.[3] Sexual dimorphism is seen; mature females reach a maximum overall length of 7\xa0cm (2.8\xa0in), while males reach only 4\xa0cm (1.6\xa0in). Sexual dimorphism is also seen in the physiological structures of the body. The anal fins on adult females resemble the dorsal fins, while the anal fins of adult males are pointed. This pointed fin, referred to as a gonopodium, is used to deposit milt inside the female. The gonopodium of G. affinis has a smooth third ray (the anteriormost elongated ray), while that of G. holbrooki bears minute denticles.[14]  Adult female mosquitofish can be identified by a gravid spot they possess on the posterior of their abdomens.

After hatching from eggs, the larvae are found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the tilefish continue to expand their burrows in the sediment throughout their lives. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.\n', ""The great northern tilefish fishery has been regulated to prevent overfishing. Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species' habitat and population.

Lateral line scales and cheek scales are also distinctive, with northern whiting possessing 66 to 72 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 3–4 rows, all of which are ctenoid. The amount of vertebrae are also diagnostic, having 34 in total. The swim bladder is the most accurate diagnostic feature, having two posterior extensions and two anterior extensions. The two anterior extensions extend forward and diverge to end on each side of the basioccipital above the auditory capsule. Two lateral extensions also commence anteriorly, each of them sending a blind tubule anterolaterally and then extending along the abdominal wall. The lateral extensions are normally convoluted and have blind tubules arising along their length. The two posterior tapering extensions project into the caudal region, with one usually longer than the other.[3]\n']"
Sillago_vittata,"[""The western school whiting (Sillago vittata), also known as the banded whiting, golden whiting and bastard whiting, is a species of benthic marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae.

Western school whiting are known to grow to 30\xa0cm in length and 275 g in weight, although unconfirmed reports suggest this might be an underestimate. The western school whiting is distributed along the Western Australian coast from Maud Landing in the north to Rottnest Island in the south. The species inhabits both shallow inshore environments and waters to depths of 55 m. The species is a benthic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms, and shows a change in diet with age and habitat. S. vittata is a multiple spawner, reproducing between December and February once it has reached one or two years of age. Juveniles inhabit protected inshore waters, moving offshore once they reach sexual maturity.

Due to its small gape size it cannot open its mouth large enough to eat many of the smaller larvae fish swimming in its habitat. Instead its diet consists of much smaller living organisms. McLane listed midge larvae and microcrustaceans as the major food items for dollar sunfish. Stomachs of specimens from Tennessee contained much detritus and filamentous algae and a few terrestrial insects (Homoptera, Hymenoptera), probably indicating both benthic- and surface-oriented feeding behavior.[4] This means that the dollar sunfish feeds on living organisms both in the water and on top of the water. They seem to focus more on the easier attainable prey, which means they don't expend a lot of energy for feeding. The juveniles and adults do not have many predators other than humans. However, the eggs and larvae are at risk of predation from larger fish such as largemouth bass, other sunfish, and some invertebrates. The only real competitor the dollar sunfish might have is another species of sunfish. This is highly unlikely though because the different species of sunfish usually occupy different habitats and zones. The micro-distribution of the dollar sunfish is characterized by a pH of 7 – 7.8, and a temperature of 16 – 28 degrees Celsius (61 – 82 degrees Fahrenheit)[11] They are often found in slow moving, small to large streams, floodplain pools, and oxbow lakes, ponds, and vegetated areas of large reservoirs. More specifically they are usually found over substrates of sand or clay overlain with silt and organic debris, and are often associated with submerged aquatic vegetation, hydrophytes, and overhanging vegetation along undercut banks.\n""]"
Lepomis_megalotis,"['Icthelis megalotis Rafinesque, 1820\n', 'The longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) is a freshwater fish in the sunfish family, Centrarchidae, of order Centrarchiformes.

A unique characteristic of longear sunfish is their elongated operculum flap, giving an appearance of a ""long ear"". It is black and often has a white margin. The pectoral fin is relatively short and would not reach the snout if it were reflected anteriorly. In breeding males, iridescent blue spots develop on the dorsum and sides and the fin membranes turn orange in all fins except the ventral ones, which may be blue to black,[4] and the pectoral ones.[4][5][6] Lepomis megalotis can be distinguished from closely related dollar sunfish L. marginatus by a greater number of cheek scale rows, by having one to two additional pectoral fin rays and by the slope of the opercular flap, which is distinctly upward in L. marginatus but is closer to horizontal in males of L. megalotis, although female and subadult L. megalotis may have upward slanting opercular flaps.[4]\n'] []"

Breeding redspotted males will develop red-orange coloration starting from their belly and extending upward as pigmented, horizontal rows of scales to within one or two rows below the lateral line, a feature that distinguishes them from paler-colored breeding males of the spotted sunfish Lepomis punctatus.[4]  Additionally, the redspotted sunfish does not have dark spots at the base of its scales, unlike spotted sunfish, in which these spots form irregular horizontal rows along the body.[4]  The redspotted sunfish has narrow bands of white or cream color at the tips of its dorsal, anal and caudal fins.[4]  It also has a dark opercular flap.  In its zone of introgression with the spotted sunfish Lepomis punctatus, which includes areas of the Florida panhandle and western Georgia within its portion of the Tennessee River watershed and in tributaries of the Coosa River, part of the Mobile basin, L. miniatus may not be distinguishable from its sister species.[4]\n', 'Lepomis miniatus feeds primarily on benthic species. Zooplankton make up between 33.3% to 74.6% of the diet of small sunfishes, about 50% of the diet of medium-sized sunfishes as they introduce larger prey into their diet. At larger sizes the redspotted sunfish shifts primarily to benthic macrofauna.[9] Many larger carnivorous fish feed on the redspotted sunfish, primarily bass.[10] Lepomis miniatus is commonly found in shallow and highly vegetated water. The species seems to prefer areas of slow moving water, 0.4\xa0cm/s.[5] The redspotted sunfish is salt tolerant and can be found in the lower reaches of estuaries, such as bayous, along the Gulf Coast west of Florida.[9]  While the redspotted sunfish has been shown to compete with other sunfish and some invasive species, like the Rio Grande cichlid in Louisiana, this competition is thought to have little effect in most cases due to the generalist diet of Lepomis miniatus.[11] A more direct danger could be invasive species that force Lepomis miniatus out of its preferred habitat, increasing the risk of predation.[10]\n']"

Sander_canadensis,"['The sauger (Sander canadensis) is a freshwater perciform fish of the family Percidae that resembles its close relative, the walleye. The species is a member of the largest vertebrate order, the Perciformes.[3] It is the most migratory percid species in North America.[4] Saugers have two dorsal fins; the first is spiny and the posterior dorsal fin is soft-rayed. Their paired fins are in the thoracic position and their caudal fin is truncated, which means squared off at the corners, a characteristic of the family Percidae. Another physical characteristic of saugers is their ctenoid scales, which are common in advanced fishes. Saugers have a fusiform body structure, and as a result are well adapted predatory fishes and are capable of swimming into fast currents with minimal drag on their bodies. They may be distinguished from walleyes by the distinctly spotted dorsal fin, by the lack of a white splotch on the caudal fin, by the rough skin over their gills, and by their generally more brassy color, or darker (almost black) color in some regions. The typical sauger  is 300 to 400\xa0g (11 to 14\xa0oz) in weight.\n', 'Saugers are widely distributed; their historical range consisted of the eastern U.S. west of the Appalachian Mountains, mostly southern, central, and western U.S., and north into southern Canada.[3] Sauger distribution and range has decreased from historical ranges because of degraded and fragmented habitat conditions.[5] Sauger distribution within their home range varies by time of year because they are migratory.[5] Saugers are more typical in rivers, whereas walleyes are more common in lakes and reservoirs. In many parts of their range, saugers are sympatric with walleyes. Hybridization between saugers and walleyes is not unknown; the hybrids, referred to as saugeyes, exhibit traits of both species.  Being intermediate in appearance between the two species, saugeyes are sometimes difficult to differentiate, but they generally carry the dark blotches characteristic of the sauger. Saugers, however, are usually smaller and better tolerate waters of higher turbidity than walleyes. Saugers require warmer summer water temperatures of 20–28\xa0°C (68–82\xa0°F). Their need for warm water is thought to affect the northern and western boundaries of their range.[6]\n'] []"
Sander_lucioperca,"['The zander (Sander lucioperca), sander or pikeperch, is a species of ray-finned fish from the family Percidae, which also includes perch, ruffe and darter. It is found in freshwater and brackish habitats in western Eurasia. It is a popular game fish and has been introduced to a variety of localities outside its native range. It is the type species of the genus Sander.\n', 'The zander was first formally described in 1758 as Perca lucioperca by Carolus Linnaeus in volume 1 of the tenth edition of Systema Naturae and he gave the type locality as ""European lakes"".[3] When Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) created the genus Sander he made Perca lucioperca its type species.[4] The zander is part of the European clade within the genus Sander which split from a common ancestor with the North American clade, which the walleye (S. vitreus) and the sauger (S. canadensis) belong to, around 20.8 million years ago. Within the European clade the Volga pikeperch (S. volgaensis) is the most basal taxon and shares features with the North American clade, such as being a broadcast spawner. In contrast in the zander and the estuarine perch (S. marinus)  the males build nests and the female spawn into these nests and the males then guard the eggs and fry. The lineage leading to the zander is thought to have diverged from the common ancestor with the Volga pikeperch circa 13.8 million years ago while the split from the estuarine perch took place around 9.1 million years ago.[5]\n'] ['The zander is the largest member of the Percidae and it usually has a long and muscular body which bears some resemblance to a Northern pike (Esox lucius), hence the alternative English common name of pikeperch.[7] The upper part of its body is green-brown in colour and this extends onto the sides as  dark vertical bars, in a pattern not dissimilar to that of the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) while the lower part of the body is creamy-white. Their caudal fin is dark and the pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are paler off-white in colour.[8] The dorsal and caudal fins are marked with rows of black spots on the membranes between the spines and rays, these are largest and most obvious on the first dorsal fin.[9] The juveniles are silvery in colour, becoming darker as they age. They have powerful jaws which are armed with many sharp teeth with two long canines in the front of each jaw.[8] They have large bulbous eyes[10] which are opaque when the fish is living in particularly turbid conditions, an adaptation to low light. There is a single flat spine on the operculum.[8] Like other members of the perch family the zander has a split dorsal fin with the first dorsal fin having 13–20 spines and 18–24 soft rays, while the anal fin has 2–3 rays and 10–14 soft rays.[2] The caudal fin is long and forked.[11]\n', 'The zander has a maximum published standard length 100 centimetres (39\xa0in), although they are more commonly found at around 50 centimetres (20\xa0in).[2] This species can reach 20\xa0kg (44\xa0lb)[12] of weight, although typical catches are considerably smaller.

The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye, which is a color morph that was once found in the southern Ontario and Quebec regions, but is now presumed extinct.[5] However, recent genetic analysis of a preserved (frozen) 'blue walleye' sample suggests that the blue and yellow walleye were simply phenotypes within the same species and do not merit separate taxonomic classification.[6]\n"", 'In parts of its range in English-speaking Canada, the walleye is known as a pickerel,  though the fish is not related to the true pickerels, which are members of the family Esocidae.[7] It is also sometimes called a dory in British English (and its common name in French is the similar doré—meaning golden or gilded), although this name is also used for various other species.[8]\n'] ['Walleyes are largely olive and gold in color (hence the French common name: doré—golden).

The rate depends partly on where in their range they occur, with southern populations often growing faster and larger. In general, females grow larger than males. Walleyes may live for decades; the maximum recorded age is 29 years. In heavily fished populations, however, few walleye older than five or six years of age are encountered.

Dissostichus_mawsoni,"['The Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), also known as the Antarctic cod, is a large, black or brown fish found in very cold (even subzero) waters of the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. It is the largest species of bony fish in the Southern Ocean, feeding largely on smaller fishes and crustaceans, and, in turn, preyed on by orcas, other toothed whales, and seals. It is caught for food and marketed as Chilean sea bass together with its sister species, the more northerly Patagonian toothfish (D. eliginoides).[1][2] Often mistakenly called ""Antarctic cod"", the Antarctic toothfish is a species in the (Nototheniidae), a family of fishes abundant in subantarctic waters. \n', 'The common name ""toothfish"" refers to the two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance.\n'] ['Fully grown, antarctic toothfish, (like their warmer-water relatives, the Patagonian toothfish, D. eleginoides) may grow to more than 1.7\xa0m (5\xa0ft 7\xa0in) in length and 135\xa0kg in mass, twice as large as the next-largest Antarctic species of fishes. Being large, and consistent with the unstructured food webs of the ocean (i.e., big fish eating little fish regardless of identity, even eating their own offspring), the Antarctic toothfish has been characterized as a voracious predator. Furthermore, by being by far the largest midwater fish in the Southern Ocean, it is thought to fill the ecological role that sharks play in other oceans.[5][6][7] As an adaptation to that role, the Antarctic toothfish is one of only five notothenioid species that, as adults, are neutrally buoyant. This buoyancy is attained at 100–120\xa0cm in length[8][9][10] and enables them to spend time above the bottom without wasting energy.[11][12] Both bottom-dwelling and mid-water prey are, therefore, available to them. Most other notothenioid fish and the majority of all Antarctic fishes, including smaller toothfish, are confined to the bottom.[7] Coloring is black to olive brown, sometimes lighter on the undersides, with a mottled pattern on body and fins. Small fish blend in very well among the benthic sponges and corals.[13] The species has a broad head, an elongated body, long dorsal and anal fins, large pectoral fins, and a rudder-like caudal fin. They typically move slowly, but are capable of speed bursts that may elude predatory seals.[12]\n', 'Over the continental shelf, Antarctic toothfish feed on shrimp (Nauticaris spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum). This loosely schooling species is also a major prey of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis).[14][15]  Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic toothfish are eaten by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Weddell seals, and possibly colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on the continental slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae), but also feed on other smaller fish species and skates (Raja spp.).[16] They also feed on the colossal squid.[17] Antarctic toothfish have been caught to depths of 2200 m, though  based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.[18]\n']"

It feeds on fish and small crustaceans. It has few predators, probably because of its venomous spines, but larger lionfish do prey on smaller ones. Moray eels have shown  resistance to the spines and it was reported that lion fish are included in their diet.

Red lionfish are clad in white stripes alternated with red, maroon or brown stripes. Adults in this species can grow as large as 47\xa0cm (18.5\xa0in)[3] in length, making it one of the largest species of lionfish in the ocean, while juveniles are typically shorter than 1 inch (2.5\xa0cm). The average red lionfish lives around 10 years.[4] As with many species within the family Scorpaenidae, it has large, venomous spines on its dorsal fin (13) as well as other venomous spines on its pelvic fins (2) and anal fins (3).  It is these fins together with the other long non-venomous fins which create an appearance similar to a mane, giving it the common name ""lionfish"". The dorsal spines deter most potential predators. Lionfish reproduce monthly and are able to quickly disperse during their larval stage for expansion of their invasive region. No definitive predators of the lionfish are known, and many organizations are promoting the harvest and consumption of lionfish in efforts to prevent further increases in the already high population densities.\n'] []"

Gasterosteus_aculeatus,"['The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a fish native to most inland and coastal waters north of 30°N. It has long been a subject of scientific study for many reasons. It shows great morphological variation throughout its range, ideal for questions about evolution and population genetics. Many populations are anadromous (they live in seawater but breed in fresh or brackish water) and very tolerant of changes in salinity, a subject of interest to physiologists. It displays elaborate breeding behavior (defending a territory, building a nest, taking care of the eggs and fry) and it can be social (living in shoals outside the breeding season) making it a popular subject of inquiry in fish ethology and behavioral ecology. Its antipredator adaptations, host-parasite interactions, sensory physiology, reproductive physiology, and endocrinology have also been much studied. Facilitating these studies is the fact that the three-spined stickleback is easy to find in nature and easy to keep in aquaria.[4]\n', 'The three-spined stickleback appears to be a rather old species that has remained morphologically unchanged for more than 10 million years. The oldest record of the species is from the Alta Mira Shale of the Monterey Formation of California, which preserves an articulated skeleton that appears essentially identical to the modern G.\xa0aculeatus complex. A slightly younger specimen is known from diatomite deposits from Lompoc that also belong to the Monterey Formation. Both specimens are known from marine deposits, suggesting a marine or anadramous lifestyle. The presence of the three-spined stickleback in the Miocene suggests that the three-spined stickleback complex must have diverged from the blackspotted stickleback prior to this point.[5][6]\n'] ['This species can occasionally reach lengths of 8\xa0cm (3.1\xa0in), but lengths of 3–4 centimetres (1.2–1.6\xa0in) at maturity are more common. The body is laterally compressed. The base of the tail is slender. The caudal fin has 12 rays. The dorsal fin has 10–14 rays; in front of it are the three spines that give the fish its name (though some individuals may have only two or four). The third spine (the one closest to the dorsal fin) is much shorter than the other two. The back of each spine is joined to the body by a thin membrane. The anal fin has eight to eleven rays and is preceded by a short spine. The pelvic fins consist of just a spine and one ray. All spines can be locked in an erect position, making the fish extremely hard to swallow by a predator. The pectoral fins are large, with 10 rays. The body bears no scales, but is protected by bony plates on the back, flanks, and belly. Only one ventral plate is present, but the number of flank plates varies greatly across the distribution range and across habitat types (see below); it is normally higher in marine populations (some freshwater populations may in fact lack lateral plates altogether).[3]\n', 'Dorsal coloration varies, but tends towards a drab olive or a silvery green, sometimes with brown mottling. The flanks and belly are silvery. In males during the breeding season, the eyes become blue and the lower head, throat, and anterior belly turn bright red.

Culaea_inconstans,"['The brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) is a small freshwater fish that is distributed across the US and Canada. It grows to a length of about 2\xa0inches. It occupies the northern part of the eastern United States, as well as the southern half of Canada. Small populations are scattered throughout the Mississippi-Great Lakes basin extending to Colorado, New Mexico, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc., though some of these areas are not native to the species.[3] This small fish inhabits clear, cool streams and lakes. They eat small Invertebrates, algae, insect larvae, and occasionally their own eggs. They are also preyed upon by smallmouth bass and northern pike.[3] Feeding time is usually dawn and sunset. The brook stickleback does have active competition mostly from minnows, but feeding times are different, along with diet.[4] Spawning occurs in midsummer. Males secure a territory, build a nest, and mate with females. Males provide protection for the eggs, ward off predators, and usually die later in the season. The nests are built out of aquatic grasses.[5] This is considered an annual species.[6] Though the brook stickleback is not considered a threatened species, deforesting and changing waters are altering ecosystems of the species. Harvesting of trees around riparian environments is having a large effect of the stream ecosystem where the brook stickleback resides.[7]\n', 'The brook stickleback was first formally described as Gasterosteus inconstans in 1840 by the American naturalist Jared Potter Kirtland with its type locality given as Trumbull County, Ohio.[8] In 1876 David Starr Jordan proposed the monospecific genus Eucalia for the brook stickleback but Jordan\'s name was invalid because it was preoccupied in Lepidoptera. Culaea was then proposed as the replacement name in 1950 by Gilbert Percy Whitley.[9] The brook stickleback is the only species in the genus Culaea which is classified within the stickleback family, Gasterosteidae.[2] Culea is a near anagram of Eucalia which is a combination of eu, meaning ""well"" and calia, meaning ""nested"", and allusion to the sticklebacks\' building of nests. The specific name inconstans means ""variable"" and is a reference to the variable number of dorsal spines and fin rays in the dorsal and anal fins.[10]\n'] ['The brook stickleback has a tapered body with a slim caudal peduncle and a fan-shaped tail. It very much resembles the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) but only has five, or occasionally six, dorsal spines. It also lacks lateral bony plates. Most of the year the colouring is grayish or olive green with a varying amount of indistinct mottling, but during the spawning season, males are nearly black and females have darker and lighter patches. This species grows to a maximum length of 3 to 5\xa0cm (1.2 to 2.0\xa0in).[11]\n', 'Culaea inconstans occurs throughout the southern half of Canada and the northern part of the eastern United States.[4] It is one of the smallest fishes in the region.[6] Brackish water populations are uncommon but certainly exist. It extends down to the southern reaches of the Mississippi River – Great Lakes drainage basins. Populations also exist in Colorado and Nebraska to the west, and in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories to the north. Though these are typically the native ranges of the brook stickleback, the species has been introduced to Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, northwestern Colorado, Wyoming, northeastern Utah and California, and even in parts of South Dakota and Washington State.[12] Certain geographical distribution studies have found that certain populations may have been native in New Mexico and still exist today. Nebraska does have brook stickleback populations, but they are generally found in small streams in the northern portion of the state. The fish have been found in Nebraska since the early part of the nineteen hundreds. River drainages that sustain brook stickleback populations are the Loup, Middle Platt, Niobrara, and smaller distributions in the Lower Platte, Missouri River tributaries, North Platte, and South Platte. Though the species appears to have an abundant distribution across North America, the Nature Conservancy has declared the species to be a S3 (vulnerable) level.[3] Reasons for the level of vulnerability could be due to increased dam construction, especially in the eastern United States. This can lead to a destruction of habitat, increase in silted waterways, alteration of stream nutrient transport, and damaged breeding grounds. Alteration of stream dynamics could also lead to a change in predator frequency, thus exposing the brook stickleback to unforeseen predators.\n']"

His fate was debated by the Greeks, for if he were allowed to live, it was feared he would avenge his father and rebuild Troy.[2]In the version given by theLittle Iliadand repeated byPausanias(x 25.4), he was killed byNeoptolemus(also called Pyrrhus), who threw the infant from the walls,[1]as predicted by Andromache in the Iliad.[3]Another version is given inIliou persis, in whichOdysseuskills Astyanax. It has also been depicted in some Greek vases that Neoptolemus killsPriam, who has taken refuge near a sacred altar, using Astyanax's dead body to club the old king to death, in front of horrified onlookers.[4]InOvid'sMetamorphoses, the child is thrown from the walls by the Greek victors (13, 413ff). InEuripides'sThe Trojan Women(719 ff), the heraldTalthybiusreveals to Andromache that Odysseus has convinced the council to have the child thrown from the walls, and the child is in this way killed. InSeneca's version ofThe Trojan Women, the prophetCalchasdeclares that Astyanax must be thrown from the walls if the Greek fleet is to be allowed favorable winds (365–70), but once led to the tower, the child himself leaps off the walls (1100–3). For Hector's mother,Hecuba, Astyanax was the only hope and consolation, and his death's announcement was a terrible climax of the catastrophe.[5]Other sources for the story of the Sack of Troy and Astyanax's death can be found in theBibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus),Hyginus(Fabula109),Tryphiodorus(Sack of Troy644–6).[6]""] []"
